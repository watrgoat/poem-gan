tapping NEWLINE as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door NEWLINE  it is some visitor i muttered tapping at my chamber door NEWLINE only this and nothing more NEWLINE ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december NEWLINE and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor NEWLINE eagerly i wished the morrow vainly i had sought to borrow NEWLINE from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore NEWLINE for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore NEWLINE nameless NEWLINE here NEWLINE for evermore NEWLINE and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain NEWLINE thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before NEWLINE so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating NEWLINE  it is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door NEWLINE some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door NEWLINE this it is and nothing more NEWLINE presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer NEWLINE  sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore NEWLINE but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping NEWLINE and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door NEWLINE that i scarce was sure i heard you here i opened wide the door NEWLINE darkness there and nothing more NEWLINE deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing NEWLINE doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before NEWLINE but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token NEWLINE and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore NEWLINE this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore NEWLINE merely this and nothing more NEWLINE back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning NEWLINE soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before NEWLINE  surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice NEWLINE let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore NEWLINE let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore NEWLINE it is the wind and nothing more NEWLINE open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter NEWLINE in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore NEWLINE not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he NEWLINE but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door NEWLINE perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door NEWLINE perched and sat and nothing more NEWLINE then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling NEWLINE by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore NEWLINE  though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven NEWLINE ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore NEWLINE tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore NEWLINE quoth the raven nevermore NEWLINE much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly NEWLINE though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore NEWLINE for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being NEWLINE ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door NEWLINE bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door NEWLINE with such name as nevermore NEWLINE but the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only NEWLINE that one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour NEWLINE nothing further then he utterednot a feather then he fluttered NEWLINE till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before NEWLINE on the morrow NEWLINE he NEWLINE will leave me as my hopes have flown before NEWLINE then the bird said nevermore NEWLINE startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken NEWLINE  doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store NEWLINE caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster NEWLINE followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore NEWLINE till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore NEWLINE of nevernevermore NEWLINE but the raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling NEWLINE straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door NEWLINE then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking NEWLINE fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore NEWLINE what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore NEWLINE meant in croaking nevermore NEWLINE this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing NEWLINE to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core NEWLINE this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining NEWLINE on the cushions velvet lining that the lamp light gloated over NEWLINE but whose velvet violet lining with the lamp light gloating over NEWLINE she NEWLINE shall press ah nevermore NEWLINE then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer NEWLINE swung by seraphim whose foot falls tinkled on the tufted floor NEWLINE  wretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these

NEWLINE for the country folk to be up and to arm NEWLINE then he said good night and with muffled oar NEWLINE silently rowed to the charlestown shore NEWLINE just as the moon rose over the bay NEWLINE where swinging wide at her moorings lay NEWLINE the somerset british man of war NEWLINE a phantom ship with each mast and spar NEWLINE across the moon like a prison bar NEWLINE and a huge black hulk that was magnified NEWLINE by its own reflection in the tide NEWLINE meanwhile his friend through alley and street NEWLINE wanders and watches with eager ears NEWLINE till in the silence around him he hears NEWLINE the muster of men at the barrack door NEWLINE the sound of arms and the tramp of feet NEWLINE and the measured tread of the grenadiers NEWLINE marching down to their boats on the shore NEWLINE then he climbed to the tower of the church NEWLINE up the wooden stairs with stealthy tread NEWLINE to the belfry chamber overhead NEWLINE and startled the pigeons from their perch NEWLINE on the sombre rafters that round him made NEWLINE masses and moving shapes of shade NEWLINE by the trembling ladder steep and tall NEWLINE to the highest window in the wall NEWLINE where he paused to listen and look down NEWLINE a moment on the roofs of the town NEWLINE and the moonlight flowing over all NEWLINE beneath in the churchyard lay the dead NEWLINE in their night encampment on the hill NEWLINE wrapped in silence so deep and still NEWLINE that he could hear like a sentinels tread NEWLINE the watchful night wind as it went NEWLINE creeping along from tent to tent NEWLINE and seeming

meanwhile impatient to mount and ride NEWLINE booted and spurred with a heavy stride NEWLINE on the opposite shore walked paul revere NEWLINE now he patted his horses side NEWLINE now gazed on the

light NEWLINE he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns NEWLINE but lingers and gazes till full on his sight NEWLINE a second lamp in the belfry burns NEWLINE a hurry of hoofs in a village street NEWLINE a shape in the moonlight a bulk in the dark NEWLINE and beneath from the pebbles in passing a spark NEWLINE struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet NEWLINE that was all and yet through the gloom and the light NEWLINE the fate of a nation was riding that night NEWLINE and the spark struck out by that steed in his flight NEWLINE kindled the land into flame with its heat NEWLINE he has left the village and mounted the steep NEWLINE and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep NEWLINE is the mystic meeting the ocean tides NEWLINE and under the alders that skirt its edge NEWLINE now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge NEWLINE is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides NEWLINE it was twelve by the village clock NEWLINE when he crossed the bridge into medford town NEWLINE he heard the crowing of the cock NEWLINE and the barking of the farmers dog NEWLINE and felt the damp of the river fog NEWLINE that rises when the sun goes down NEWLINE it was one by the village clock NEWLINE when he galloped into lexington NEWLINE he saw the gilded weathercock NEWLINE swim in the moonlight as he passed NEWLINE and the meeting house windows blank and bare NEWLINE gaze at him with a spectral glare NEWLINE as if they already stood aghast NEWLINE at the bloody work they would look upon NEWLINE it was two by the village clock NEWLINE when he came to the bridge in concord town NEWLINE he heard the bleating of the flock NEWLINE and the twitter of birds among the trees NEWLINE and felt the breath of the morning breeze NEWLINE blowing over the meadows brown NEWLINE and one was safe and asleep in his bed NEWLINE who at the bridge would be first to fall NEWLINE who that day would be lying dead NEWLINE pierced by a british musket ball NEWLINE you know the

NEWLINE benedict knew by the hob nailed shoes it was basil the blacksmith NEWLINE and by her beating heart evangeline knew who was with him NEWLINE  welcome the farmer exclaimed as their footsteps paused on the threshold NEWLINE  welcome basil my friend come take thy place on the settle NEWLINE close by the chimney side which is always empty without thee NEWLINE take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco NEWLINE never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling NEWLINE smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams NEWLINE round and red as the

bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad NEWLINE ever in cheerfullest mood art thou when others are filled with NEWLINE gloomy forebodings of ill and see only ruin before them NEWLINE happy art thou as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe NEWLINE pausing a moment to take the pipe that evangeline brought him NEWLINE and with a coal from the embers had lighted he slowly continued NEWLINE  four days now are passed since the english ships at their anchors NEWLINE ride in the gaspereaus mouth with their cannon pointed against us NEWLINE what their design may be is

alarm the hearts of the people NEWLINE then made answer the farmer perhaps some friendlier purpose NEWLINE brings these ships to our shores perhaps the harvests in england NEWLINE by untimely rains or untimelier heat have been blighted NEWLINE and from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children NEWLINE  not so thinketh the folk in the village said warmly the blacksmith NEWLINE shaking his head as in doubt then heaving a sigh he continued NEWLINE  louisburg is not forgotten nor beau sejour nor port royal NEWLINE many already have fled to the forest and lurk on its outskirts NEWLINE waiting with anxious hearts the dubious fate of to morrow NEWLINE arms have been taken from us and warlike weapons of all kinds NEWLINE nothing is left but the blacksmiths sledge and the

for this is the night of the contract NEWLINE built are the house and the barn the merry lads of the village NEWLINE strongly have built them and well and breaking the glebe round about them NEWLINE filled the barn with hay and the house with food for a twelvemonth NEWLINE rene leblanc will be here anon with his papers and inkhorn NEWLINE shall we not then be glad and rejoice in the joy of our children NEWLINE as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lovers NEWLINE blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken NEWLINE and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered NEWLINE canto iii NEWLINE bent like a laboring oar that toils in the surf of the ocean NEWLINE bent but not broken by age was the form of the notary public NEWLINE shocks of yellow hair like the silken floss of the maize hung NEWLINE over his shoulders his forehead was high and glasses with horn bows NEWLINE sat astride on his nose with a look of wisdom supernal NEWLINE father of twenty children was he and more than a hundred NEWLINE childrens children rode on his knee and heard his great watch tick NEWLINE four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive NEWLINE suffering much in an old french fort as the friend of the english NEWLINE now though warier grown without all guile or suspicion NEWLINE ripe in wisdom was he but patient and simple and childlike NEWLINE he was beloved by all and most of all by the children NEWLINE for he told them tales of the loup garou in the forest NEWLINE and of the goblin that came in the night to water the

the stable NEWLINE and how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell NEWLINE and of the marvellous powers of four leaved clover and horseshoes NEWLINE with whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village NEWLINE then up rose from his seat by the fireside basil the blacksmith NEWLINE knocked from his pipe the ashes and slowly extending his right hand NEWLINE  father leblanc he exclaimed thou hast heard the talk in the village NEWLINE and perchance canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand NEWLINE then with modest demeanor made answer the notary public NEWLINE  gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser NEWLINE and what their errand may be i know not better than others NEWLINE yet am i not of those who imagine some evil intention NEWLINE brings them here for we are at peace and why then molest us NEWLINE  gods name shouted the hasty and somewhat irascible blacksmith NEWLINE  must we in all things look for the how and the why and the wherefore NEWLINE daily injustice is done and might is the right of the strongest NEWLINE but without heeding his warmth continued the notary public NEWLINE  man is unjust but god is just and finally justice NEWLINE triumphs and well i remember a story that often consoled me NEWLINE when as a captive i lay in the old french fort at port royal NEWLINE this was the old mans favorite tale and he loved to repeat it NEWLINE when his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them NEWLINE  once in an ancient city whose name i no longer remember NEWLINE raised aloft on a column a brazen statue of justice NEWLINE stood in the public square upholding the scales in its left hand NEWLINE and in its right a sword as an emblem that justice presided NEWLINE over the laws of the land and the hearts and homes of the people NEWLINE even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance NEWLINE having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them NEWLINE but in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted NEWLINE might took the place of right and the weak were oppressed and the mighty NEWLINE ruled with an iron rod then it chanced in a noblemans palace NEWLINE that a necklace of pearls was lost and erelong a suspicion NEWLINE fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household NEWLINE she after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold NEWLINE patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of justice NEWLINE as to her father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended NEWLINE lo over the city a tempest rose and the bolts of the thunder NEWLINE smote the statue of bronze and hurled in wrath from its left hand NEWLINE down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance NEWLINE and in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie NEWLINE into whose clay built walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven NEWLINE silenced but not convinced when the story was ended the blacksmith NEWLINE stood like a man who fain would speak but findeth no language NEWLINE all his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face as the vapors NEWLINE freeze in fantastic shapes on the window panes in the winter NEWLINE then evangeline lighted the brazen lamp on the table NEWLINE filled till it overflowed the pewter tankard with home brewed NEWLINE nut brown ale that was famed for its strength in the village of grand pr NEWLINE while from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn NEWLINE wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties NEWLINE naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle NEWLINE orderly all things proceeded and duly and well were completed NEWLINE and the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin NEWLINE then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table NEWLINE three times the old mans fee in solid pieces of silver NEWLINE and the notary rising and blessing the bride and the bridegroom NEWLINE lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare NEWLINE wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed NEWLINE while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside NEWLINE till evangeline brought the draught board out of its corner NEWLINE soon was the game begun in friendly contention the old men NEWLINE laughed at each lucky hit or unsuccessful manoeuver NEWLINE laughed when a man was crowned or a breach was made in the king row NEWLINE meanwhile apart in the twilight gloom of a windows embrasure NEWLINE sat the lovers and whispered together beholding the moon rise NEWLINE over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows NEWLINE silently one by one in the infinite meadows of heaven NEWLINE blossomed the lovely stars the forget me nots of the angels NEWLINE thus was the evening passed anon the bell from the belfry NEWLINE rang out the hour of nine the village curfew and straightway NEWLINE rose the guests and departed and silence reigned in the household NEWLINE many a farewell word and sweet good night on the door step NEWLINE lingered long in evangelines heart and filled it with gladness NEWLINE carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearth stone NEWLINE and on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer NEWLINE soon with a soundless step the foot of evangeline followed NEWLINE up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness NEWLINE lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden NEWLINE silent she passed the hall and entered the door of her chamber NEWLINE simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothes press NEWLINE ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded NEWLINE linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven NEWLINE this was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage NEWLINE better than flocks and herds being proofs of her skill as a housewife NEWLINE soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight NEWLINE streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden NEWLINE swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean NEWLINE ah she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with NEWLINE naked snow white feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber NEWLINE little she dreamed that below among the trees of the orchard NEWLINE waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow NEWLINE yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness NEWLINE passed over her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight NEWLINE flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment NEWLINE and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass NEWLINE forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps NEWLINE as out of abrahams tent young ishmael wandered with hagar NEWLINE canto iv NEWLINE pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of grand pr NEWLINE pleasantly gleamed in the soft sweet air the basin of minas NEWLINE the ships with their wavering shadows were riding at anchor NEWLINE life had long been astir in the village and clamorous labor NEWLINE knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning NEWLINE now from the country around from the farms and neighboring hamlets NEWLINE came in their holiday dresses the blithe acadian peasants NEWLINE many a glad good morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk NEWLINE made the bright air brighter as up from the numerous meadows NEWLINE where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward NEWLINE group after group appeared and joined or passed on the highway NEWLINE long ere noon in the village all sounds of labor were silenced NEWLINE thronged were the streets with people and noisy groups at the house doors NEWLINE sat in the cheerful sun and rejoiced and gossiped together NEWLINE every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted NEWLINE for with this simple people who lived like brothers together NEWLINE all things were held in common and what one had was anothers NEWLINE yet under benedicts roof hospitality seemed more abundant NEWLINE for evangeline stood among the guests of her father NEWLINE bright was her face with smiles and words of welcome and gladness NEWLINE fell from her beautiful lips and blessed the cup as she gave it NEWLINE under the open sky in the odorous air of the orchard NEWLINE stript of its golden fruit was spread the feast of betrothal NEWLINE there in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated NEWLINE there good benedict sat and

and light from the leaves alternately played on his snow white NEWLINE hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler NEWLINE glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from

them NEWLINE fairest of all the maids was evangeline benedicts daughter NEWLINE noblest of all the youths was gabriel son of the blacksmith NEWLINE so passed the morning away and lo with a summons sonorous NEWLINE sounded the bell from its tower and over the meadows a drum beat NEWLINE thronged erelong was the church with men without in the churchyard NEWLINE waited the women they stood by the graves and hung on the headstones NEWLINE garlands of autumn leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest NEWLINE then came the guard from the ships and marching proudly among them NEWLINE entered the sacred portal with loud and dissonant clangor NEWLINE echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement NEWLINE echoed a moment only and slowly the ponderous portal NEWLINE closed and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers NEWLINE then uprose their commander and spoke from the steps of the altar NEWLINE holding aloft in his hands with its seals the royal commission NEWLINE  you are convened this day he said by his majestys orders NEWLINE clement and kind has he been but how you have answered his kindness NEWLINE let your own hearts reply to my natural make and

bellowing fly the herds and seek to break their enclosures NEWLINE so on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker NEWLINE silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose NEWLINE louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger NEWLINE and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the door way NEWLINE vain was the hope of escape and cries and fierce imprecations NEWLINE rang through the house of prayer and high over the heads of the others NEWLINE rose with his arms uplifted the figure of basil the blacksmith NEWLINE as on a stormy sea a spar is tossed by the billows NEWLINE flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted NEWLINE  down with the tyrants of england we never have sworn them allegiance NEWLINE death to these foreign soldiers who seize on our homes and our harvests NEWLINE more he fain would have said but the merciless hand of a soldier NEWLINE smote him upon the mouth and dragged him down to the pavement NEWLINE in the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention NEWLINE lo the door of the chancel opened and father felician NEWLINE entered with serious mien and ascended the steps of the altar NEWLINE raising his reverend hand with a gesture he awed into silence NEWLINE all that clamorous throng and thus he spake to his people NEWLINE deep were his tones and solemn in accents measured and mournful NEWLINE spake he as after the tocsins alarum distinctly the clock strikes NEWLINE  what is this that ye do my children what madness has seized you NEWLINE forty years of my life have i labored among you and taught you NEWLINE not in word alone but in deed to love one another NEWLINE is this the fruit of my toils of my vigils and prayers and privations NEWLINE have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness NEWLINE this is the house of the prince of peace and would you profane it NEWLINE thus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred NEWLINE lo where the crucified christ from his cross is gazing upon you NEWLINE see in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion NEWLINE hark how those lips still repeat the prayer o father forgive them NEWLINE let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us NEWLINE let us repeat it now and say o father forgive them NEWLINE few were his words of rebuke but deep in the hearts of his people NEWLINE sank they and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak NEWLINE while they repeated his prayer and said o father forgive them NEWLINE then came the evening service the tapers gleamed from the altar NEWLINE fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded NEWLINE not with their lips alone but their hearts and the ave maria NEWLINE sang they and fell on their knees and their souls with devotion translated NEWLINE rose on the ardor of prayer like elijah ascending to heaven NEWLINE meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill and on all sides NEWLINE wandered wailing from house to house the women and children NEWLINE long at her fathers door evangeline stood with her right hand NEWLINE shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun that descending NEWLINE lighted the village street with mysterious splendor and roofed each NEWLINE peasants cottage with golden thatch and emblazoned its windows NEWLINE long within had been spread the snow white cloth on the table NEWLINE there stood the wheaten loaf and the honey fragrant with wild flowers NEWLINE there stood the tankard of ale and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy NEWLINE and at the head of the board the great arm chair of the farmer NEWLINE thus did evangeline wait at her fathers door as the sunset NEWLINE threw the long shadows of trees over the broad ambrosial meadows NEWLINE ah on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen NEWLINE and from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended NEWLINE charity meekness love and hope and forgiveness and patience NEWLINE then all forgetful of self she wandered into the village NEWLINE cheering with looks and words the mournful hearts of the women NEWLINE as over the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed NEWLINE urged by their household cares and the weary feet of their children NEWLINE down sank the great red sun and in golden glimmering vapors NEWLINE veiled the light of his face like the prophet descending from sinai NEWLINE sweetly over the village the bell of the angelus sounded NEWLINE meanwhile amid the gloom by the church evangeline lingered NEWLINE all was silent within and in vain at the door and the windows NEWLINE stood she and listened and looked till overcome by emotion NEWLINE  gabriel cried she aloud with tremulous voice but no answer NEWLINE came from the graves of the dead nor the gloomier grave of the living NEWLINE slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father NEWLINE smouldered the fire on the hearth on the board was the supper untasted NEWLINE empty and drear was each room and haunted with phantoms of terror NEWLINE sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber NEWLINE in the dead of the night she heard the disconsolate rain fall NEWLINE loud on the withered leaves of the sycamore tree by the window NEWLINE keenly the lightning flashed and the voice of the echoing thunder NEWLINE told her that god was in heaven and governed the world he created NEWLINE then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of heaven NEWLINE soothed was her troubled soul and she peacefully slumbered till morning NEWLINE canto v NEWLINE four times the sun had risen and set and now on the fifth day NEWLINE cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farm house NEWLINE soon over the yellow fields in silent and mournful procession NEWLINE came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the acadian women NEWLINE driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the sea shore NEWLINE pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings NEWLINE ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland NEWLINE close at their sides their children ran and urged on the oxen NEWLINE while in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings NEWLINE thus to the gaspereaus mouth they hurried and there on the sea beach NEWLINE piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants NEWLINE all day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply NEWLINE all day long the wains came laboring down from the village NEWLINE late in the afternoon when the sun was near to his setting NEWLINE echoed far over the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard NEWLINE thither the women and children thronged on a sudden the church doors NEWLINE opened and forth came the guard and marching in gloomy procession NEWLINE followed the long imprisoned but patient acadian farmers NEWLINE even as pilgrims who journey afar from their homes and their country NEWLINE sing as they go and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn NEWLINE so with songs on their lips the acadian peasants descended NEWLINE down from the church to the shore amid their wives and their daughters NEWLINE foremost the young men came and raising together their voices NEWLINE sang with tremulous lips a chant of the catholic missions NEWLINE  sacred heart of the saviour o inexhaustible fountain NEWLINE fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience NEWLINE then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside NEWLINE joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them NEWLINE mingled their notes therewith like voices of spirits departed NEWLINE half way down to the shore evangeline waited in silence NEWLINE not overcome with grief but strong in the hour of affliction NEWLINE calmly and sadly she waited until the procession approached her NEWLINE and she beheld the face of gabriel pale with emotion NEWLINE tears then filled her eyes and eagerly running to meet him NEWLINE clasped she his hands and laid her head on his shoulder and whispered NEWLINE  gabriel be of good cheer for if we love one another NEWLINE nothing in truth can harm us whatever mischances may happen NEWLINE smiling she spake these words then suddenly paused for her father NEWLINE saw she slowly advancing alas how changed was his aspect NEWLINE gone was the glow from his cheek and the fire from his eye and his footstep NEWLINE heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom NEWLINE but with a smile and a sigh she clasped his neck and embraced him NEWLINE speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not NEWLINE thus to the gaspereaus mouth moved on that mournful procession NEWLINE there disorder prevailed and the tumult and stir of embarking NEWLINE busily plied the freighted boats and in the confusion NEWLINE wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children NEWLINE left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties NEWLINE so unto separate ships were basil and gabriel carried NEWLINE while in despair on the shore evangeline stood with her father NEWLINE half the task was not done when the sun went down and the twilight NEWLINE deepened and darkened around and in haste the refluent ocean NEWLINE fled away from the shore and left the line of the sand beach NEWLINE covered with waifs of the tide with kelp and the slippery sea weed NEWLINE farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons NEWLINE like to a gypsy camp or a leaguer after a battle NEWLINE all escape cut off by the sea and the sentinels near them NEWLINE lay encamped for the night the houseless acadian farmers NEWLINE back to its nethermost caves retreated the bellowing ocean NEWLINE dragging adown the beach the rattling pebbles and leaving NEWLINE inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors NEWLINE then as the night descended the herds returned from their pastures NEWLINE sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders NEWLINE lowing they waited and long at the well known bars of the farm yard NEWLINE waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid NEWLINE silence reigned in the streets from the church no angelus sounded NEWLINE rose no smoke from the roofs and gleamed no lights from the windows NEWLINE but on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled NEWLINE built of the drift wood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest NEWLINE round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered NEWLINE voices of women were heard and of men and the crying of children NEWLINE onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish NEWLINE wandered the faithful priest consoling and blessing and cheering NEWLINE like unto shipwrecked paul on melitas desolate sea shore NEWLINE thus he approached the place where evangeline sat with her father NEWLINE and in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man NEWLINE haggard and hollow and wan and without either thought or emotion NEWLINE een as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken NEWLINE vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him NEWLINE vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not NEWLINE but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering fire light NEWLINE  benedicite murmured the priest in tones of compassion NEWLINE more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents NEWLINE faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold NEWLINE hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow NEWLINE silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden NEWLINE raising his tearful eyes to the silent stars that above them NEWLINE moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals NEWLINE then sat he down at her side and they wept together in silence NEWLINE suddenly rose from the south a light as in autumn the blood red NEWLINE moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven and over the horizon NEWLINE titan like stretches its hundred hands upon mountain and meadow NEWLINE seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together NEWLINE broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village NEWLINE gleamed on the sky and the sea and the ships that lay in the roadstead NEWLINE columns of shining smoke uprose and flashes of flame were NEWLINE thrust through their folds and withdrawn like the quivering hands of a martyr NEWLINE then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting NEWLINE whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred house tops NEWLINE started the sheeted smoke with flashes of flame intermingled NEWLINE these things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard NEWLINE speechless at first they stood then cried aloud in their anguish NEWLINE  we shall behold no more our homes in the village of grand pr NEWLINE loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farm yards NEWLINE thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle NEWLINE came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted NEWLINE then rose a sound of dread such as startles the sleeping encampments NEWLINE far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the nebraska NEWLINE when the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind NEWLINE or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river NEWLINE such was the sound that arose on the night as the herds and the horses NEWLINE broke through their folds and fences and madly rushed over the meadows NEWLINE overwhelmed with the sight yet speechless the priest and the maiden NEWLINE gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them NEWLINE and as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion NEWLINE lo from his seat he had fallen and stretched abroad on the sea shore NEWLINE motionless lay his form from which the soul had departed NEWLINE slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head and the maiden NEWLINE knelt at her fathers side and wailed aloud in her terror NEWLINE then in a swoon she sank and lay with her head on his bosom NEWLINE through the long night she lay in deep oblivious slumber NEWLINE and when she woke from the trance she beheld a multitude near her NEWLINE faces of friends she beheld that were mournfully gazing upon her NEWLINE pallid with tearful eyes and looks of saddest compassion NEWLINE still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape NEWLINE reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her NEWLINE and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses NEWLINE then a familiar voice she heard as it said to the people NEWLINE  let us bury him here by the sea when a happier season NEWLINE brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile NEWLINE then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard NEWLINE such were the words of the priest and there in haste by the sea side NEWLINE having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches NEWLINE but without bell or book they buried the farmer of grand pr NEWLINE and as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow NEWLINE lo with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation NEWLINE solemnly answered the sea and mingled its roar with the dirges NEWLINE t was the returning tide that afar from the waste of the ocean NEWLINE with the first dawn of the day came heaving and hurrying landward NEWLINE then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking NEWLINE and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor NEWLINE leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins NEWLINE part the second NEWLINE canto i NEWLINE many a weary year had passed since the burning of grand pr NEWLINE when on the falling tide the freighted vessels departed NEWLINE bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile NEWLINE exile without an end and without an example in story NEWLINE far asunder on separate coasts the acadians landed NEWLINE scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast NEWLINE strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland NEWLINE friendless homeless hopeless they wandered from city to city NEWLINE from the cold lakes of the north to sultry southern savannas NEWLINE from the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the father of waters NEWLINE seizes the hills in his hands and drags them down to the ocean NEWLINE deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth NEWLINE friends they sought and homes and many despairing heart broken NEWLINE asked of the earth but a grave and no longer a friend nor a fireside NEWLINE written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards NEWLINE long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered NEWLINE lowly and meek in spirit and patiently suffering all things NEWLINE fair was she and young but alas before her extended NEWLINE dreary and vast and silent the desert of life with its pathway NEWLINE marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her NEWLINE passions long extinguished and hopes long dead and abandoned NEWLINE as the emigrants way over the western desert is marked by NEWLINE camp fires long consumed and bones that bleach in the sunshine NEWLINE something there was in her life incomplete imperfect unfinished NEWLINE as if a morning of june with all its music and sunshine NEWLINE suddenly paused in the sky and fading slowly descended NEWLINE into the east again from whence it late had arisen NEWLINE sometimes she lingered in towns till urged by the fever within her NEWLINE urged by a restless longing the hunger and thirst of the spirit NEWLINE she would commence again her endless search and endeavor NEWLINE sometimes in churchyards strayed and gazed on the crosses and tombstones NEWLINE sat by some nameless grave and thought that perhaps in its bosom NEWLINE he was already at rest and she longed to slumber beside him NEWLINE sometimes a rumor a hearsay an inarticulate whisper NEWLINE came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward NEWLINE sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him NEWLINE but it was long ago in some far off place or forgotten NEWLINE  gabriel lajeunesse they said yes we have seen him NEWLINE he was with basil the blacksmith and both have gone to the prairies NEWLINE coureurs des bois are they and famous hunters and trappers NEWLINE  gabriel lajeunesse said others o yes we have seen him NEWLINE he is a voyageur in the lowlands of louisiana NEWLINE then would they say dear child why dream and wait for him longer NEWLINE are there not other youths as fair as gabriel others NEWLINE who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal NEWLINE here is baptiste leblanc the notarys son who has loved thee NEWLINE many a tedious year come give him thy hand and be happy NEWLINE thou art too fair to be left to braid st catherines tresses NEWLINE then would evangeline answer serenely but sadly i cannot NEWLINE whither my heart has gone there follows my hand and not elsewhere NEWLINE for when the heart goes before like a lamp and illumines the pathway NEWLINE many things are made clear that else lie hidden in darkness NEWLINE thereupon the priest her friend and father confessor NEWLINE said with a smile o daughter thy god thus speaketh within thee NEWLINE talk not of wasted affection affection never was wasted NEWLINE if it enrich not the heart of another its waters returning NEWLINE back to their springs like the rain shall fill them full of refreshment NEWLINE that which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain NEWLINE patience accomplish thy labor accomplish thy work of affection NEWLINE sorrow and silence are strong and patient endurance is godlike NEWLINE therefore accomplish thy labor of love till the heart is made godlike NEWLINE purified strengthened perfected and rendered more worthy of heaven NEWLINE cheered by the good mans words evangeline labored and waited NEWLINE still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean NEWLINE but with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered despair not NEWLINE thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort NEWLINE bleeding barefooted over the shards and thorns of existence NEWLINE let me essay o muse to follow the wanderers footsteps NEWLINE not through each devious path each changeful year of existence NEWLINE but as a traveller follows a streamlets course through the valley NEWLINE far from its margin at times and seeing the gleam of its water NEWLINE here and there in some open space and at intervals only NEWLINE then drawing nearer its banks through sylvan glooms that conceal it NEWLINE though he behold it not he can hear its continuous murmur NEWLINE happy at length if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet NEWLINE canto ii NEWLINE it was the month of may far down the beautiful river NEWLINE past the ohio shore and past the mouth of the wabash NEWLINE into the golden stream of the broad and swift mississippi NEWLINE floated a cumbrous boat that was rowed by acadian boatmen NEWLINE it was a band of exiles a raft as it were from the shipwrecked NEWLINE nation scattered along the coast now floating together NEWLINE bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune NEWLINE men and women and children who guided by hope or by hearsay NEWLINE sought for their kith and their kin among the few acred farmers NEWLINE on the acadian coast and the prairies of fair opelousas NEWLINE with them evangeline went and her guide the father felician NEWLINE onward over sunken sands through a wilderness sombre with forests NEWLINE day after day they glided adown the turbulent river NEWLINE night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders NEWLINE now through rushing chutes among green islands where plumelike NEWLINE cotton trees nodded their shadowy crests they swept with the current NEWLINE then emerged into broad lagoons where silvery sand bars NEWLINE lay in the stream and along the wimpling waves of their margin NEWLINE shining with snow white plumes large flocks of pelicans waded NEWLINE level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river NEWLINE shaded by china trees in the midst of luxuriant gardens NEWLINE stood the houses of planters with negro cabins and dove cots NEWLINE they were approaching the region where reigns perpetual summer NEWLINE where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron NEWLINE sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward NEWLINE they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine NEWLINE soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters NEWLINE which like a network of steel extended in every direction NEWLINE over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress NEWLINE met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in mid air NEWLINE waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals NEWLINE deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons NEWLINE home to their roosts in the cedar trees returning at sunset NEWLINE or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter NEWLINE lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water NEWLINE gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches NEWLINE down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin NEWLINE dreamlike and indistinct and strange were all things around them NEWLINE and over their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness NEWLINE strange forebodings of ill unseen and that cannot be compassed NEWLINE as at the tramp of a horses hoof on the turf of the prairies NEWLINE far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa NEWLINE so at the hoof beats of fate with sad forebodings of evil NEWLINE shrinks and closes the heart ere the stroke of doom has attained it NEWLINE but evangelines heart was sustained by a vision that faintly NEWLINE floated before her eyes and beckoned her on through the moonlight NEWLINE it was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom NEWLINE through those shadowy aisles had gabriel wandered before her NEWLINE and every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer NEWLINE then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen NEWLINE and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure NEWLINE sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle NEWLINE wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang NEWLINE breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest NEWLINE soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music NEWLINE multitudinous echoes awoke and died in the distance NEWLINE over the watery floor and beneath the reverberant branches NEWLINE but not a voice replied no answer came from the darkness NEWLINE and when the echoes had ceased like a sense of pain was the silence NEWLINE then evangeline slept but the boatmen rowed through the midnight NEWLINE silent at times then singing familiar canadian boat songs NEWLINE such as they sang of old on their own acadian rivers NEWLINE while through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert NEWLINE far off indistinct as of wave or wind in the forest NEWLINE mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator NEWLINE thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades and before them NEWLINE lay in the golden sun the lakes of the atchafalaya NEWLINE water lilies in myriads rocked on the slight undulations NEWLINE made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus NEWLINE lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen NEWLINE faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms NEWLINE and with the heat of noon and numberless sylvan islands NEWLINE fragrant and thickly embowered with blossoming hedges of roses NEWLINE near to whose shores they glided along invited to slumber NEWLINE soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended NEWLINE under the boughs of wachita willows that grew by the margin NEWLINE safely their boat was moored and scattered about on the greensward NEWLINE tired with their midnight toil the weary travellers slumbered NEWLINE over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar NEWLINE swinging from its great arms the trumpet flower and the grapevine NEWLINE hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of jacob NEWLINE on whose pendulous stairs the angels ascending descending NEWLINE were the swift humming birds that flitted from blossom to blossom NEWLINE such was the vision evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it NEWLINE filled was her heart with love and the dawn of an opening heaven NEWLINE lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial NEWLINE nearer ever nearer among the numberless islands NEWLINE darted a light swift boat that sped away over the water NEWLINE urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers NEWLINE northward its prow was turned to the land of the bison and beaver NEWLINE at the helm sat a youth with countenance thoughtful and careworn NEWLINE dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow and a sadness NEWLINE somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written NEWLINE gabriel was it who weary with waiting unhappy and restless NEWLINE sought in the western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow NEWLINE swiftly they glided along close under the lee of the island NEWLINE but by the opposite bank and behind a screen of palmettos NEWLINE so that they saw not the boat where it lay concealed in the willows NEWLINE all undisturbed by the dash of their oars and unseen were the sleepers NEWLINE angel of god was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden NEWLINE swiftly they glided away like the shade of a cloud on the prairie NEWLINE after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance NEWLINE as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden NEWLINE said with a sigh to the friendly priest o father felician NEWLINE something says in my heart that near me gabriel wanders NEWLINE is it a foolish dream an idle and vague superstition NEWLINE or has an angel passed and revealed the truth to my spirit NEWLINE then with a blush she added alas for my credulous fancy NEWLINE unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning NEWLINE but made answer the reverend man and he smiled as he answered NEWLINE  daughter thy words are not idle nor are they to me without meaning NEWLINE feeling is deep and still and the word that floats on the surface NEWLINE is as the tossing buoy that betrays where the anchor is hidden NEWLINE therefore trust to thy heart and to what the world calls illusions NEWLINE gabriel truly is near thee for not far away to the southward NEWLINE on the banks of the teche are the towns of st maur and st martin NEWLINE there the long wandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom NEWLINE there the long absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold NEWLINE beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruit trees NEWLINE under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens NEWLINE bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest NEWLINE they who dwell there have named it the eden of louisiana NEWLINE with these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey NEWLINE softly the evening came the sun from the western horizon NEWLINE like a magician extended his golden wand over the landscape NEWLINE twinkling vapors arose and sky and water and forest NEWLINE seemed all on fire at the touch and melted and mingled together NEWLINE hanging between two skies a cloud with edges of silver NEWLINE floated the boat with its dripping oars on the motionless water NEWLINE filled was evangelines heart with inexpressible sweetness NEWLINE touched by the magic spell the sacred fountains of feeling NEWLINE glowed with the light of love as the skies and waters around her NEWLINE then from a neighboring thicket the mocking bird wildest of singers NEWLINE swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung over the water NEWLINE shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music NEWLINE that the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen NEWLINE plaintive at first were the tones and sad then soaring to madness NEWLINE seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied bacchantes NEWLINE single notes were then heard in sorrowful low lamentation NEWLINE till having gathered them all he flung them abroad in derision NEWLINE as when after a storm a gust of wind through the tree tops NEWLINE shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches NEWLINE with such a prelude as this and hearts that throbbed with emotion NEWLINE slowly they entered the teche where it flows through the green opelousas NEWLINE and through the amber air above the crest of the woodland NEWLINE saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling NEWLINE sounds of a horn they heard and the distant lowing of cattle NEWLINE canto iii NEWLINE near to the bank of the river oershadowed by oaks from whose branches NEWLINE garlands of spanish moss and of mystic mistletoe flaunted NEWLINE such as the druids cut down with golden hatchets at yule tide NEWLINE stood secluded and still the house of the herdsman a garden NEWLINE girded it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms NEWLINE filling the air with fragrance the house itself was of timbers NEWLINE hewn from the cypress tree and carefully fitted together NEWLINE large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported NEWLINE rose wreathed vine encircled a broad and spacious veranda NEWLINE haunt of the humming bird and the bee extended around it NEWLINE at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden NEWLINE stationed the dove cots were as loves perpetual symbol NEWLINE scenes of endless wooing and endless contentions of rivals NEWLINE silence reigned over the place the line of shadow and sunshine NEWLINE ran near the tops of the trees but the house itself was in shadow NEWLINE and from its chimney top ascending and slowly expanding NEWLINE into the evening air a thin blue column of smoke rose NEWLINE in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway NEWLINE through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie NEWLINE into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending NEWLINE full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas NEWLINE hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics NEWLINE stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grapevines NEWLINE just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie NEWLINE mounted upon his horse with spanish saddle and stirrups NEWLINE sat a herdsman arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin NEWLINE broad and brown was the face that from under the spanish sombrero NEWLINE gazed on the peaceful scene with the lordly look of its master NEWLINE round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing NEWLINE quietly in the meadows and breathing the vapory freshness NEWLINE that uprose from the river and spread itself over the landscape NEWLINE slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side and expanding NEWLINE fully his broad deep chest he blew a blast that resounded NEWLINE wildly and sweet and far through the still damp air of the evening NEWLINE suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle NEWLINE rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean NEWLINE silent a moment they gazed then bellowing rushed over the prairie NEWLINE and the whole mass became a cloud a shade in the distance NEWLINE then as the herdsman turned to the house through the gate of the garden NEWLINE saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him NEWLINE suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement and forward NEWLINE rushed with extended arms and exclamations of wonder NEWLINE when they beheld his face they recognized basil the blacksmith NEWLINE hearty his welcome was as he led his guests to the garden NEWLINE there in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer NEWLINE gave they vent to their hearts and renewed their friendly embraces NEWLINE laughing and weeping by turns or sitting silent and thoughtful NEWLINE thoughtful for gabriel came not and now dark doubts and misgivings NEWLINE stole over the maidens heart and basil somewhat embarrassed NEWLINE broke the silence and said if you came by the atchafalaya NEWLINE how have you nowhere encountered my gabriels boat on the bayous NEWLINE over evangelines face at the words of basil a shade passed NEWLINE tears came into her eyes and she said with a tremulous accent NEWLINE  gone is gabriel gone and concealing her face on his shoulder NEWLINE all her oerburdened heart gave way and she wept and lamented NEWLINE then the good basil said and his voice grew blithe as he said it NEWLINE  be of good cheer my child it is only to day he departed NEWLINE foolish boy he has left me alone with my herds and my horses NEWLINE moody and restless grown and tried and troubled his spirit NEWLINE could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence NEWLINE thinking ever of thee uncertain and sorrowful ever NEWLINE ever silent or speaking only of thee and his troubles NEWLINE he at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens NEWLINE tedious even to me that at length i bethought me and sent him NEWLINE unto the town of adayes to trade for mules with the spaniards NEWLINE thence he will follow the indian trails to the ozark mountains NEWLINE hunting for furs in the forests on rivers trapping the beaver NEWLINE therefore be of good cheer we will follow the fugitive lover NEWLINE he is not far on his way and the fates and the streams are against him NEWLINE up and away to morrow and through the red dew of the morning NEWLINE we will follow him fast and bring him back to his prison NEWLINE then glad voices were heard and up from the banks of the river NEWLINE borne aloft on his comrades arms came michael the fiddler NEWLINE long under basils roof had he lived like a god on olympus NEWLINE having no other care than dispensing music to mortals NEWLINE far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle NEWLINE  long live michael they cried our brave acadian minstrel NEWLINE as they bore him aloft in triumphal procession and straightway NEWLINE father felician advanced with evangeline greeting the old man NEWLINE kindly and oft and recalling the past while basil enraptured NEWLINE hailed with hilarious joy his old companions and gossips NEWLINE laughing loud and long and embracing mothers and daughters NEWLINE much they marvelled to see the wealth of the cidevant blacksmith NEWLINE all his domains and his herds and his patriarchal demeanor NEWLINE much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate NEWLINE and of the prairie whose numberless herds were his who would take them NEWLINE each one thought in his heart that he too would go and do likewise NEWLINE thus they ascended the steps and crossing the breezy veranda NEWLINE entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil NEWLINE waited his late return and they rested and feasted together NEWLINE over the joyous feast the sudden darkness descended NEWLINE all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver NEWLINE fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors NEWLINE brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight NEWLINE then from his station aloft at the head of the table the herdsman NEWLINE poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion NEWLINE lighting his pipe that was filled with sweet natchitoches tobacco NEWLINE thus he spake to his guests who listened and smiled as they listened NEWLINE  welcome once more my friends who long have been friendless and homeless NEWLINE welcome once more to a home that is better perchance than the old one NEWLINE here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers NEWLINE here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer NEWLINE smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil as a keel through the water NEWLINE all the year round the orange groves are in blossom and grass grows NEWLINE more in a single night than a whole canadian summer NEWLINE here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies NEWLINE here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber NEWLINE with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses NEWLINE after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests NEWLINE no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads NEWLINE burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle NEWLINE speaking these words he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils NEWLINE while his huge brown hand came thundering down on the table NEWLINE so that the guests all started and father felician astounded NEWLINE suddenly paused with a pinch of snuff half way to his nostrils NEWLINE but the brave basil resumed and his words were milder and gayer NEWLINE  only beware of the fever my friends beware of the fever NEWLINE for it is not like that of our cold acadian climate NEWLINE cured by wearing a spider hung round ones neck in a nutshell NEWLINE then there were voices heard at the door and footsteps approaching NEWLINE sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda NEWLINE it was the neighboring

boatmen already were waiting NEWLINE thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness NEWLINE swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them NEWLINE blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert NEWLINE not that day nor the next nor yet the day that succeeded NEWLINE found they trace of his course in lake or forest or river NEWLINE nor after

spreading between these streams are the wondrous beautiful prairies NEWLINE billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine NEWLINE bright with luxuriant clusters of roses and purple amorphas NEWLINE over them wandered the buffalo herds and the elk and the roebuck NEWLINE over them wandered the wolves and herds of riderless horses NEWLINE fires that blast and blight and winds that are weary with travel NEWLINE over them wander the scattered tribes of ishmaels children NEWLINE staining the desert with blood and above their terrible war trails NEWLINE circles and sails aloft on pinions majestic the vulture NEWLINE like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle NEWLINE by invisible stairs ascending and scaling the heavens NEWLINE here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders NEWLINE here and there rise groves from the margins of swift running rivers NEWLINE and the grim taciturn bear the anchorite monk of the desert NEWLINE climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brook side NEWLINE and over all is the sky the clear and crystalline heaven NEWLINE like the protecting hand of god inverted above them NEWLINE into this wonderful land at the base of the ozark mountains NEWLINE gabriel far had entered with hunters and trappers behind him NEWLINE day after day with their indian guides the maiden and basil NEWLINE followed his flying steps and thought each day to oertake him NEWLINE sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his camp fire NEWLINE rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall NEWLINE when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes NEWLINE and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary NEWLINE hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana NEWLINE showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them NEWLINE once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered NEWLINE into the little camp an indian woman whose features NEWLINE wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow NEWLINE she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people NEWLINE from the far off hunting grounds of the cruel camanches NEWLINE where her canadian husband a coureur des bois had been murdered NEWLINE touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome NEWLINE gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them NEWLINE on the buffalo meat and the venison cooked on the embers NEWLINE but when their meal was done and basil and all his companions NEWLINE worn with the long days march and the chase of the deer and the bison NEWLINE stretched themselves on the ground and slept where the quivering fire light NEWLINE flashed on their swarthy cheeks and their forms wrapped up in their blankets NEWLINE then at the door of evangelines tent she sat and repeated NEWLINE slowly with soft low voice and the charm of her indian accent NEWLINE all the tale of her love with its pleasures and pains and reverses NEWLINE much evangeline wept at the tale and to know that another NEWLINE hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed NEWLINE moved to the depths of her soul by pity and womans compassion NEWLINE yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her NEWLINE she in turn related her love and all its disasters NEWLINE mute with wonder the shawnee sat and when she had ended NEWLINE still was mute but at length as if a mysterious horror NEWLINE passed through her brain she spake and repeated the tale of the mowis NEWLINE mowis the bridegroom of snow who won and wedded a maiden NEWLINE but when the morning came arose and passed from the wigwam NEWLINE fading and melting away and dissolving into the sunshine NEWLINE till she beheld him no more though she followed far into the forest NEWLINE then in those sweet low tones that seemed like a weird incantation NEWLINE told she the tale of the fair lilinau who was wooed by a phantom NEWLINE that through the pines over her fathers lodge in the hush of the twilight NEWLINE breathed like the evening wind and whispered love to the maiden NEWLINE till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest NEWLINE and nevermore returned nor was seen again by her people NEWLINE silent with wonder and strange surprise evangeline listened NEWLINE to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her NEWLINE seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress NEWLINE slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose NEWLINE lighting the little tent and with a mysterious splendor NEWLINE touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland NEWLINE with a delicious sound the brook rushed by and the branches NEWLINE swayed and sighed overhead in scarcely audible whispers NEWLINE filled with the thoughts of love was evangelines heart but a secret NEWLINE subtile sense crept in of pain and indefinite terror NEWLINE as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow NEWLINE it was no earthly fear a breath from the region of spirits NEWLINE seemed to float in the air of night and she felt for a moment NEWLINE that like the indian maid she too was pursuing a phantom NEWLINE with this thought she slept and the fear and the phantom had vanished NEWLINE early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee NEWLINE said as they journeyed along on the western slope of these mountains NEWLINE dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission NEWLINE much he teaches the people and tells them of mary and jesus NEWLINE loud laugh their hearts with joy and weep with pain as they hear him NEWLINE then with a sudden and secret emotion evangeline answered NEWLINE  let us go to the mission for there good tidings await us NEWLINE thither they turned their steeds and behind a spur of the mountains NEWLINE just as the sun went down they heard a murmur of voices NEWLINE and in a meadow green and broad by the bank of a river NEWLINE saw the tents of the christians the tents of the jesuit mission NEWLINE under a towering oak that stood in the midst of the village NEWLINE knelt the black robe chief with his children a crucifix fastened NEWLINE high on the trunk of the tree and overshadowed by grapevines NEWLINE looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it NEWLINE this was their rural chapel aloft through the intricate arches NEWLINE of its aerial roof arose the chant of their vespers NEWLINE mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches NEWLINE silent with heads uncovered the travellers nearer approaching NEWLINE knelt on the swarded floor and joined in the evening devotions NEWLINE but when the service was done and the benediction had fallen NEWLINE forth from the hands of the priest like seed from the hands of the sower NEWLINE slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers and bade them NEWLINE welcome and when they replied he smiled with benignant expression NEWLINE hearing the homelike sounds of his mother tongue in the forest NEWLINE and with words of kindness conducted them into his wigwam NEWLINE there upon mats and skins they reposed and on cakes of the maize ear NEWLINE feasted and slaked their thirst from the water gourd of the teacher NEWLINE soon was their story told and the priest with solemnity answered NEWLINE  not six suns have risen and set since gabriel seated NEWLINE on this mat by my side where now the maiden reposes NEWLINE told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey NEWLINE soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness NEWLINE but on evangelines heart fell his words as in winter the snow flakes NEWLINE fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed NEWLINE  far to the north he has gone continued the priest but in autumn NEWLINE when the chase is done will return again to the mission NEWLINE then evangeline said and her voice was meek and submissive NEWLINE  let me remain with thee for my soul is sad and afflicted NEWLINE so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow NEWLINE mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions NEWLINE homeward basil returned and evangeline stayed at the mission NEWLINE slowly slowly slowly the days succeeded each other NEWLINE days and weeks and months and the fields of maize that were springing NEWLINE green from the ground when a stranger she came now waving above her NEWLINE lifted their slender shafts with leaves interlacing and forming NEWLINE cloisters for mendicant crows and granaries pillaged by squirrels NEWLINE then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens NEWLINE blushed at each blood red ear for that betokened a lover NEWLINE but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the corn field NEWLINE even the blood red ear to evangeline brought not her lover NEWLINE  patience the priest would say have faith and thy prayer will be answered NEWLINE look at this vigorous plant that lifts its head from the meadow NEWLINE see how its leaves are turned to the north as true as the magnet NEWLINE this is the compass flower that the finger of god has planted NEWLINE here in the houseless wild to direct the travellers journey NEWLINE over the sea like pathless limitless waste of the desert NEWLINE such in the soul of man is faith the blossoms of passion NEWLINE gay and luxuriant flowers are brighter and fuller of fragrance NEWLINE but they beguile us and lead us astray and their odor is deadly NEWLINE only this humble plant can guide us here and hereafter NEWLINE crown us with asphodel flowers that are wet with the dews of nepenthe NEWLINE so came the autumn and passed and the winter yet gabriel came not NEWLINE blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird NEWLINE sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not NEWLINE but on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted NEWLINE sweeter than song of bird or hue or odor of blossom NEWLINE far to the north and east it said in the michigan forests NEWLINE gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the saginaw river NEWLINE and with returning guides that sought the lakes of st lawrence NEWLINE saying a sad farewell evangeline went from the mission NEWLINE when over weary ways by long and perilous marches NEWLINE she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests NEWLINE found she the hunters lodge deserted and fallen to ruin NEWLINE thus did the long sad years glide on and in seasons and places NEWLINE divers and distant far was seen the wandering maiden NEWLINE now in the tents of grace of the meek moravian missions NEWLINE now in the noisy camps and the battle fields of the army NEWLINE now in secluded hamlets in towns and populous cities NEWLINE like a phantom she came and passed away unremembered NEWLINE fair was she and young when in hope began the long journey NEWLINE faded was she and old when in disappointment it ended NEWLINE each succeeding year stole something away from her beauty NEWLINE leaving behind it broader and deeper the gloom and the shadow NEWLINE then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray over her forehead NEWLINE dawn of another life that broke over her earthy horizon NEWLINE as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning NEWLINE canto v NEWLINE in that delightful land which is washed by the delawares waters NEWLINE guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle NEWLINE stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded NEWLINE there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty NEWLINE and the streets still re echo the names of the trees of the forest NEWLINE as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested NEWLINE there from the troubled sea had evangeline landed an exile NEWLINE finding among the children of penn a home and a country NEWLINE there old rene leblanc had died and when he departed NEWLINE saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants NEWLINE something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city NEWLINE something that spake to her heart and made her no longer a stranger NEWLINE and her ear was pleased with the thee and thou of the quakers NEWLINE for it recalled the past the old acadian country NEWLINE where all men were equal and all were brothers and sisters NEWLINE so when the fruitless search the disappointed endeavor NEWLINE ended to recommence no more upon earth uncomplaining NEWLINE thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps NEWLINE as from a mountains top the rainy mists of the morning NEWLINE roll away and afar we behold the landscape below us NEWLINE sun illumined with shining rivers and cities and hamlets NEWLINE so fell the mists from her mind and she saw the world far below her NEWLINE dark no longer but all illumined with love and the pathway NEWLINE which she had climbed so far lying smooth and fair in the distance NEWLINE gabriel was not forgotten within her heart was his image NEWLINE clothed in the beauty of love and youth as last she beheld him NEWLINE only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence NEWLINE into her thoughts of him time entered not for it was not NEWLINE over him years had no power he was not changed but transfigured NEWLINE he had become to her heart as one who is dead and not absent NEWLINE patience and abnegation of self and devotion to others NEWLINE this was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her NEWLINE so was her love diffused but like to some odorous spices NEWLINE suffered no waste nor loss though filling the air with aroma NEWLINE other hope had she none nor wish in life but to follow NEWLINE meekly with reverent steps the sacred feet of her saviour NEWLINE thus many years she lived as a sister of mercy frequenting NEWLINE lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city NEWLINE where distress and want concealed themselves from the sunlight NEWLINE where disease and sorrow in garrets languished neglected NEWLINE night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated NEWLINE loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city NEWLINE high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper NEWLINE day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs NEWLINE plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market NEWLINE met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings NEWLINE then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city NEWLINE presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons NEWLINE darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn NEWLINE and as the tides of the sea arise in the month of september NEWLINE flooding some silver stream till it spreads to a lake in the meadow NEWLINE so death flooded life and oerflowing its natural margin NEWLINE spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of existence NEWLINE wealth had no power to bribe nor beauty to charm the oppressor NEWLINE but all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger NEWLINE only alas the poor who had neither friends nor attendants NEWLINE crept away to die in the almshouse home of the homeless NEWLINE then in the suburbs it stood in the midst of meadows and woodlands NEWLINE now the city surrounds it but still with its gateway and wicket NEWLINE meek in the midst of splendor its humble walls seem to echo NEWLINE softly the words of the lord the poor ye always have with you NEWLINE thither by night and by day came the sister of mercy the dying NEWLINE looked up into her face and thought indeed to behold there NEWLINE gleams of celestial light encircle her forehead with splendor NEWLINE such as the artist paints over the brows of saints and apostles NEWLINE or such as hangs by night over a city seen at a distance NEWLINE unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial NEWLINE into whose shining gates erelong their spirits would enter NEWLINE thus on a sabbath morn through the streets deserted and silent NEWLINE wending her quiet way she entered the door of the almshouse NEWLINE sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden NEWLINE and she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them NEWLINE that the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty NEWLINE then as she mounted the stairs to the corridors cooled by the east wind NEWLINE distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of christ church NEWLINE while intermingled with these across the meadows were wafted NEWLINE sounds of psalms that were sung by the swedes in their church at wicaco NEWLINE soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit NEWLINE something within her said at length thy trials are ended NEWLINE and with light in her looks she entered the chambers of sickness NEWLINE noiselessly moved about the assiduous careful attendants NEWLINE moistening the feverish lip and the aching brow and in silence NEWLINE closing the sightless eyes of the dead and concealing their faces NEWLINE where on their pallets they lay like drifts of snow by the roadside NEWLINE many a languid head upraised as evangeline entered NEWLINE turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed for her presence NEWLINE fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison NEWLINE and as she looked around she saw how death the consoler NEWLINE laying his hand upon many a heart had healed it forever NEWLINE many familiar forms had disappeared in the night time NEWLINE vacant their places were or filled already by strangers NEWLINE suddenly as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder NEWLINE still she stood with her colorless lips apart while a shudder NEWLINE ran through her frame and forgotten the flowerets dropped from her fingers NEWLINE and from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning NEWLINE then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish NEWLINE that the dying heard it and started up from their pillows NEWLINE on the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man NEWLINE long and thin and gray were the locks that shaded his temples NEWLINE but as he lay in the in morning light his face for a moment NEWLINE seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood NEWLINE so are will not to be changed the faces of those who are dying NEWLINE hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever NEWLINE as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals NEWLINE that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over NEWLINE motionless senseless dying he lay and his spirit exhausted NEWLINE seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness NEWLINE darkness of slumber and death forever sinking and sinking NEWLINE then through those realms of shade in multiplied reverberations NEWLINE heard he that cry of pain and through the hush that succeeded NEWLINE whispered a gentle voice in accents tender and saint like NEWLINE  gabriel o my beloved and died away into silence NEWLINE then he beheld in a dream once more the home of his childhood NEWLINE green acadian meadows with sylvan rivers among them NEWLINE village and mountain and woodlands and walking under their shadow NEWLINE as in the days of her youth evangeline rose in his vision NEWLINE tears came into his eyes and as slowly he lifted his eyelids NEWLINE vanished the vision away but evangeline knelt by his bedside NEWLINE vainly he strove to whisper her name for the accents unuttered NEWLINE died on his lips and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken NEWLINE vainly he strove to rise and evangeline kneeling beside him NEWLINE kissed his dying lips and laid his head on her bosom NEWLINE sweet was the light of his eyes but it suddenly sank into darkness NEWLINE as when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement NEWLINE all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow NEWLINE all the aching of heart the restless unsatisfied longing NEWLINE all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience NEWLINE and as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom NEWLINE meekly she bowed her own and murmured father i thank thee NEWLINE still stands the forest primeval but far away from its shadow NEWLINE side by side in their nameless graves the lovers are sleeping NEWLINE under the humble walls of the little catholic churchyard NEWLINE in the heart of the city they lie unknown and unnoticed NEWLINE daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them NEWLINE thousands of throbbing hearts where theirs are at rest and forever NEWLINE thousands of aching brains where theirs no longer are busy NEWLINE thousands of toiling hands where theirs have

intermingled with light and his voice was subdued with emotion  NEWLINE tenderness pity regret as after a pause he proceeded  NEWLINE  yonder there on the hill by the sea lies buried rose standish  NEWLINE beautiful rose of love that bloomed for me by the wayside  NEWLINE she was the first to die of all who came in the mayflower  NEWLINE green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there  NEWLINE better to hide from the indian scouts the graves of our people  NEWLINE lest they should count them and see how many already have perished  NEWLINE sadly his face he averted and strode up and down and was thoughtful  NEWLINE fixed to the opposite wall was a shelf of books and among them NEWLINE prominent three distinguished alike for bulk and for binding  NEWLINE bariffe s artillery guide and the commentaries of caesar  NEWLINE out of the latin translated by arthur goldinge of london  NEWLINE and as if guarded by these between them was standing the bible  NEWLINE musing a moment before them miles standish paused as if doubtful NEWLINE which of the three he should choose for his consolation and comfort  NEWLINE whether the wars of the hebrews the famous campaigns of the romans  NEWLINE or the artillery practice designed for belligerent christians  NEWLINE finally down from its shelf he dragged the ponderous roman  NEWLINE seated himself at the window and opened the book and in silence NEWLINE turned over the well worn leaves where thumb marks thick on the margin  NEWLINE like the trample of feet proclaimed the battle was hottest  NEWLINE nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling  NEWLINE busily writing epistles important to go by the mayflower  NEWLINE ready to sail on the morrow or next day at latest god willing  NEWLINE homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter  NEWLINE letters written by alden and full of the name of priscilla  NEWLINE full of the name and the fame of the puritan maiden priscilla  NEWLINE ii NEWLINE love and friendship NEWLINE nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling  NEWLINE or an occasional sigh from the laboring heart of the captain  NEWLINE reading the marvellous words and achievements of julius caesar  NEWLINE after a while he exclaimed as he smote with his hand palm downwards  NEWLINE heavily on the page a wonderful man was this caesar  NEWLINE you are a writer and i am a fighter but here is a fellow NEWLINE who could both write and fight and in both was equally skilful  NEWLINE straightway answered and spake john alden the comely the youthful  NEWLINE  yes he was equally skilled as you say with his pen and his weapons  NEWLINE somewhere have i read but where i forget he could dictate NEWLINE seven letters at once at the same time writing his memoirs  NEWLINE  truly continued the captain not heeding or hearing the other  NEWLINE  truly a wonderful man was caius julius caesar  NEWLINE better be first he said in a little iberian village  NEWLINE than be second in rome and i think he was right when he said it  NEWLINE twice was he married before he was twenty and many times after  NEWLINE battles five hundred he fought and a thousand cities he conquered  NEWLINE he too fought in flanders as he himself has recorded  NEWLINE finally he was stabbed by his friend the orator brutus  NEWLINE now do you know what he did on a certain occasion in flanders  NEWLINE when the rear guard of his army retreated the front giving way too  NEWLINE and the immortal twelfth legion was crowded so closely together NEWLINE there was no room for their swords why he seized a shield from a soldier  NEWLINE put himself straight at the head of his troops and commanded the captains  NEWLINE calling on each by his name to order forward the ensigns  NEWLINE then to widen the ranks and give more room for their weapons  NEWLINE so he won the day the battle of something or other  NEWLINE that is what i always say if you wish a thing to be well done  NEWLINE you must do it yourself you must not leave it to others  NEWLINE all was silent again the captain continued his reading  NEWLINE nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling NEWLINE writing epistles important to go next day by the mayflower  NEWLINE filled with the name and the fame of the puritan maiden priscilla  NEWLINE every sentence began or closed with the name of priscilla  NEWLINE till the treacherous pen to which he confided the secret  NEWLINE strove to betray it by singing and shouting the name of priscilla  NEWLINE finally closing his book with a bang of the ponderous cover  NEWLINE sudden and loud as the sound of a soldier grounding his musket  NEWLINE thus to the young man spake miles standish the captain of plymouth  NEWLINE  when you have finished your work i have something important to tell you  NEWLINE be not however in haste i can wait i shall not be impatient  NEWLINE straightway alden replied as he folded the last of his letters  NEWLINE pushing his papers aside and giving respectful attention  NEWLINE  speak for whenever you speak i am always ready to listen  NEWLINE always ready to hear whatever pertains to miles standish  NEWLINE thereupon answered the captain embarrassed and culling his phrases  NEWLINE  t is not good for a man to be alone say the scriptures  NEWLINE this i have said before and again and again i repeat it  NEWLINE every hour in the day i think it and feel it and say it  NEWLINE since rose standish died my life has been weary and dreary  NEWLINE sick at heart have i been beyond the healing of friendship  NEWLINE oft in my lonely hours have i thought of the maiden priscilla  NEWLINE she is alone in the world her father and mother and brother NEWLINE died in the winter together i saw her going and coming  NEWLINE now to the grave of the dead and now to the bed of the dying  NEWLINE patient courageous and strong and said to myself that if ever NEWLINE there were angels on earth as there are angels in heaven  NEWLINE two have i seen and known and the angel whose name is priscilla NEWLINE holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned  NEWLINE long have i cherished the thought but never have dared to reveal it  NEWLINE being a coward in this though valiant enough for the most part  NEWLINE go to the damsel priscilla the loveliest maiden of plymouth  NEWLINE say that a blunt old captain a man not of words but of actions  NEWLINE offers his hand and his heart the hand and heart of a soldier  NEWLINE not in these words you know but this in short is my meaning  NEWLINE i am a maker of war and not a maker of phrases  NEWLINE you who are bred as a scholar can say it in elegant language  NEWLINE such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers  NEWLINE such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden  NEWLINE when he had spoken john alden the fair haired taciturn stripling  NEWLINE all aghast at his words surprised embarrassed bewildered  NEWLINE trying to mask his dismay by treating the subject with lightness  NEWLINE trying to smile and yet feeling his heart stand still in his bosom  NEWLINE just as a timepiece stops in a house that is stricken by lightning  NEWLINE thus made answer and spake or rather stammered than answered  NEWLINE  such a message as that i am sure i should mangle and mar it  NEWLINE if you would have it well done i am only repeating your maxim — NEWLINE you must do it yourself you must not leave it to others  NEWLINE but with the air of a man whom nothing can turn from his purpose  NEWLINE gravely shaking his head made answer the captain of plymouth  NEWLINE  truly the maxim is good and i do not mean to gainsay it  NEWLINE but we must use it discreetly and not waste powder for nothing  NEWLINE now as i said before i was never a maker of phrases  NEWLINE i can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender  NEWLINE but march up to a woman with such a proposal i dare not  NEWLINE i am not afraid of bullets nor shot from the mouth of a cannon  NEWLINE but of a thundering no point blank from the mouth of a woman  NEWLINE that i confess i am afraid of nor am i ashamed to confess it  NEWLINE so you must grant my request for you are an elegant scholar  NEWLINE having the graces of speech and skill in the turning of phrases  NEWLINE taking the hand of his friend who still was reluctant and doubtful  NEWLINE holding it long in his own and pressing it kindly he added  NEWLINE  though i have spoken thus lightly yet deep is the feeling that prompts me  NEWLINE surely you cannot refuse what i ask in the name of our friendship  NEWLINE then made answer john alden the name of friendship is sacred  NEWLINE what you demand in that name i have not the power to deny you  NEWLINE so the strong will prevailed subduing and moulding the gentler  NEWLINE friendship prevailed over love and alden went on his errand  NEWLINE iii NEWLINE the lover s errand NEWLINE so the strong will prevailed and alden went on his errand  NEWLINE out of the street of the village and into the paths of the forest  NEWLINE into the tranquil woods where blue birds and robins were building NEWLINE towns in the populous trees with hanging gardens of verdure  NEWLINE peaceful aerial cities of joy and affection and freedom  NEWLINE all around him was calm but within him commotion and conflict  NEWLINE love contending with friendship and self with each generous impulse  NEWLINE to and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing  NEWLINE as in a foundering ship with every roll of the vessel  NEWLINE washes the bitter sea the merciless surge of the ocean  NEWLINE  must i relinquish it all he cried with a wild lamentation  NEWLINE  must i relinquish it all the joy the hope the illusion  NEWLINE was it for this i have loved and waited and worshipped in silence  NEWLINE was it for this i have followed the flying feet and the shadow NEWLINE over the wintry sea to the desolate shores of new england  NEWLINE truly the heart is deceitful and out of its depths of corruption NEWLINE rise like an exhalation the misty phantoms of passion  NEWLINE angels of light they seem but are only delusions of satan  NEWLINE all is clear to me now i feel it i see it distinctly  NEWLINE this is the hand of the lord it is laid upon me in anger  NEWLINE for i have followed too much the heart s desires and devices  NEWLINE worshipping astaroth blindly and impious idols of baal  NEWLINE this is the cross i must bear the sin and the swift retribution  NEWLINE so through the plymouth woods john alden went on his errand  NEWLINE crossing the brook at the ford where it brawled over pebble and shallow  NEWLINE gathering still as he went the may flowers blooming around him  NEWLINE fragrant filling the air with a strange and wonderful sweetness  NEWLINE children lost in the woods and covered with leaves in their slumber  NEWLINE  puritan flowers he said and the type of puritan maidens  NEWLINE modest and simple and sweet the very type of priscilla  NEWLINE so i will take them to her to priscilla the may flower of plymouth  NEWLINE modest and simple and sweet as a parting gift will i take them  NEWLINE breathing their silent farewells as they fade and wither and perish  NEWLINE soon to be thrown away as is the heart of the giver  NEWLINE so through the plymouth woods john alden went on his errand  NEWLINE came to an open space and saw the disk of the ocean  NEWLINE sailless sombre and cold with the comfortless breath of the east wind  NEWLINE saw the new built house and people at work in a meadow  NEWLINE heard as he drew near the door the musical voice of priscilla NEWLINE singing the hundredth psalm the grand old puritan anthem  NEWLINE music that luther sang to the sacred words of the psalmist  NEWLINE full of the breath of the lord consoling and comforting many  NEWLINE then as he opened the door he beheld the form of the maiden NEWLINE seated beside her wheel and the carded wool like a snow drift NEWLINE piled at her knee her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle  NEWLINE while with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion  NEWLINE open wide on her lap lay the well worn psalm book of ainsworth  NEWLINE printed in amsterdam the words and the music together  NEWLINE rough hewn angular notes like stones in the wall of a churchyard NEWLINE   NEWLINE darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses  NEWLINE such was the book from whose pages she sang the old puritan anthem  NEWLINE she the puritan girl in the solitude of the forest  NEWLINE making the humble house and the modest apparel of home spun NEWLINE beautiful with her beauty and rich with the wealth of her being  NEWLINE over him rushed like a wind that is keen and cold and relentless  NEWLINE thoughts of what might have been and the weight and woe of his errand  NEWLINE all the dreams that had faded and all the hopes that had vanished  NEWLINE all his life henceforth a dreary and tenantless mansion  NEWLINE haunted by vain regrets and pallid sorrowful faces  NEWLINE still he said to himself and almost fiercely he said it  NEWLINE  let not him that putteth his hand to the plough look backwards  NEWLINE though the ploughshare cut through the flowers of life to its fountains  NEWLINE though it pass over the graves of the dead and the hearths of the living  NEWLINE it is the will of the lord and his mercy endureth for ever  NEWLINE so he entered the house and the hum of the wheel and the singing NEWLINE suddenly ceased for priscilla aroused by his step on the threshold  NEWLINE rose as he entered and gave him her hand in signal of welcome  NEWLINE saying i knew it was you when i heard your step in the passage  NEWLINE for i was thinking of you as i sat there singing and spinning  NEWLINE awkward and dumb with delight that a thought of him had been mingled NEWLINE thus in the sacred psalm that came from the heart of the maiden  NEWLINE silent before her he stood and gave her the flowers for an answer  NEWLINE finding no words for his thought he remembered that day in the winter  NEWLINE after the first great snow when he broke a path from the village  NEWLINE reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway  NEWLINE stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house and priscilla NEWLINE laughed at his snowy locks and gave him a seat by the fireside  NEWLINE grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snow storm  NEWLINE had he but spoken then perhaps not in vain had he spoken  NEWLINE now it was all too late the golden moment had vanished  NEWLINE so he stood there abashed and gave her the flowers for an answer  NEWLINE then they sat down and talked of the birds and the beautiful spring time  NEWLINE talked of their friends at home and the mayflower that sailed on the morrow  NEWLINE  i have been thinking all day said gently the puritan maiden  NEWLINE  dreaming all night and thinking all day of the hedge rows of england — NEWLINE they are in blossom now and the country is all like a garden  NEWLINE thinking of lanes and fields and the song of the lark and the linnet  NEWLINE seeing the village street and familiar faces of neighbors NEWLINE going about as of old and stopping to gossip together  NEWLINE and at the end of the street the village church with the ivy NEWLINE climbing the old gray tower and the quiet graves in the churchyard  NEWLINE kind are the people i live with and dear to me my religion  NEWLINE still my heart is so sad that i wish myself back in old england  NEWLINE you will say it is wrong but i cannot help it i almost NEWLINE wish myself back in old england i feel so lonely and wretched  NEWLINE thereupon answered the youth — indeed i do not condemn you  NEWLINE stouter hearts than a woman s have quailed in this terrible winter  NEWLINE yours is tender and trusting and needs a stronger to lean on  NEWLINE so i have come to you now with an offer and proffer of marriage NEWLINE made by a good man and true miles standish the captain of plymouth  NEWLINE thus he delivered his message the dexterous writer of letters — NEWLINE did not embellish the theme nor array it in beautiful phrases  NEWLINE but came straight to the point and blurted it out like a schoolboy  NEWLINE even the captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly  NEWLINE mute with amazement and sorrow priscilla the puritan maiden NEWLINE looked into alden s face her eyes dilated with wonder  NEWLINE feeling his words like a blow that stunned her and rendered her speechless  NEWLINE till at length she exclaimed interrupting the ominous silence  NEWLINE  if the great captain of plymouth is so very eager to wed me  NEWLINE why does he not come himself and take the trouble to woo me  NEWLINE if i am not worth the wooing i surely am not worth the winning  NEWLINE then john alden began explaining and smoothing the matter  NEWLINE making it worse as he went by saying the captain was busy — NEWLINE had no time for such things such things the words grating harshly NEWLINE fell on the ear of priscilla and swift as a flash she made answer  NEWLINE  has he no time for such things as you call it before he is married  NEWLINE would he be likely to find it or make it after the wedding  NEWLINE that is the way with you men you do not understand us you cannot  NEWLINE when you have made up your minds after thinking of this one and that one  NEWLINE choosing selecting rejecting comparing one with another  NEWLINE then you make known your desire with abrupt and sudden avowal  NEWLINE and are offended and hurt and indignant perhaps that a woman NEWLINE does not respond at once to a love that she never suspected  NEWLINE does not attain at a bound the height to which you have been climbing  NEWLINE this is not right nor just for surely a woman s affection NEWLINE is not a thing to be asked for and had for only the asking  NEWLINE when one is truly in love one not only says it but shows it  NEWLINE had he but waited awhile had he only showed that he loved me  NEWLINE even this captain of yours who knows at last might have won me  NEWLINE old and rough as he is but now it never can happen  NEWLINE still john alden went on unheeding the words of priscilla  NEWLINE urging the suit of his friend explaining persuading expanding  NEWLINE spoke of his courage and skill and of all his battles in flanders  NEWLINE how with the people of god he had chosen to suffer affliction  NEWLINE how in return for his zeal they had made him captain of plymouth  NEWLINE he was a gentleman born could trace his pedigree plainly NEWLINE back to hugh standish of duxbury hall in lancashire england  NEWLINE who was the son of ralph and the grandson of thurston de standish  NEWLINE heir unto vast estates of which he was basely defrauded  NEWLINE still bore the family arms and had for his crest a cock argent NEWLINE combed and wattled gules and all the rest of the blazon  NEWLINE he was a man of honor of noble and generous nature  NEWLINE though he was rough he was kindly she knew how during the winter NEWLINE he had attended the sick with a hand as gentle as woman s  NEWLINE somewhat hasty and hot he could not deny it and headstrong  NEWLINE stern as a soldier might be but hearty and placable always  NEWLINE not to be laughed at and scorned because he was little of stature  NEWLINE for he was great of heart magnanimous courtly courageous  NEWLINE any woman in plymouth nay any woman in england  NEWLINE might be happy and proud to be called the wife of miles standish  NEWLINE but as he warmed and glowed in his simple and eloquent language  NEWLINE quite forgetful of self and full of the praise of his rival  NEWLINE archly the maiden smiled and with eyes over running with laughter  NEWLINE said in a tremulous voice why do not you speak for yourself john  NEWLINE iv NEWLINE john alden NEWLINE into the open air john alden perplexed and bewildered  NEWLINE rushed like a man insane and wandered alone by the sea side  NEWLINE paced up and down the sands and bared his head to the east wind  NEWLINE cooling his heated brow and the fire and fever within him  NEWLINE slowly as out of the heavens with apocalyptical splendors  NEWLINE sank the city of god in the vision of john the apostle  NEWLINE so with its cloudy walls of chrysolite jasper and sapphire  NEWLINE sank the broad red sun and over its turrets uplifted NEWLINE glimmered the golden reed of the angel who measured the city  NEWLINE  welcome o wind of the east he exclaimed in his wild exultation  NEWLINE  welcome o wind of the east from the caves of the misty atlantic  NEWLINE blowing over fields of dulse and measureless meadows of sea grass  NEWLINE blowing over rocky wastes and the grottos and gardens of ocean  NEWLINE lay thy cold moist hand on my burning forehead and wrap me NEWLINE close in thy garments of mist to allay the fever within me  NEWLINE like an awakened conscience the sea was moaning and tossing  NEWLINE beating remorseful and loud the mutable sands of the sea shore  NEWLINE fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending  NEWLINE love triumphant and crowned and friendship wounded and bleeding  NEWLINE passionate cries of desire and importunate pleadings of duty  NEWLINE  is it my fault he said that the maiden has chosen between us  NEWLINE is it my fault that he failed my fault that i am the victor  NEWLINE then within him there thundered a voice like the voice of the prophet  NEWLINE  it hath displeased the lord and he thought of david s transgression  NEWLINE bathsheba s beautiful face and his friend in the front of the battle  NEWLINE shame and confusion of guilt and abasement and self condemnation  NEWLINE overwhelmed him at once and he cried in the deepest contrition  NEWLINE  it hath displeased the lord it is the temptation of satan  NEWLINE then uplifting his head he looked at the sea and beheld there NEWLINE dimly the shadowy form of the mayflower riding at anchor  NEWLINE rocked on the rising tide and ready to sail on the morrow  NEWLINE heard the voices of men through the mist the rattle of cordage NEWLINE thrown on the deck the shouts of the mate and the sailors ay ay sir  NEWLINE clear and distinct but not loud in the dripping air of the twilight  NEWLINE still for a moment he stood and listened and stared at the vessel  NEWLINE then went hurriedly on as one who seeing a phantom  NEWLINE stops then quickens his pace and follows the beckoning shadow  NEWLINE  yes it is plain to me now he murmured the hand of the lord is NEWLINE leading me out of the land of darkness the bondage of error  NEWLINE through the sea that shall lift the walls of its waters around me  NEWLINE hiding me cutting me off from the cruel thoughts that pursue me  NEWLINE back will i go over the ocean this dreary land will abandon  NEWLINE her whom i may not love and him whom my heart has offended  NEWLINE better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in england  NEWLINE close by my mother s side and among the dust of my kindred  NEWLINE better be dead and forgotten than living in shame and dishonor  NEWLINE sacred and safe and unseen in the dark of the narrow chamber NEWLINE with me my secret shall lie like a buried jewel that glimmers NEWLINE bright on the hand that is dust in the chambers of silence and darkness — NEWLINE yes as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter  NEWLINE thus as he spake he turned in the strength of his strong resolution  NEWLINE leaving behind him the shore and hurried along in the twilight  NEWLINE through the congenial gloom of the forest silent and sombre  NEWLINE till he beheld the lights in the seven houses of plymouth  NEWLINE shining like seven stars in the dusk and mist of the evening  NEWLINE soon he entered his door and found the redoubtable captain NEWLINE sitting alone and absorbed in the martial pages of caesar  NEWLINE fighting some great campaign in hainault or brabant or flanders  NEWLINE  long have you been on your errand he said with a cheery demeanor  NEWLINE even as one who is waiting an answer and fears not the issue  NEWLINE  not far off is the house although the woods are between us  NEWLINE but you have lingered so long that while you were going and coming NEWLINE i have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city  NEWLINE come sit down and in order relate to me all that has happened  NEWLINE then john alden spake and related the wondrous adventure  NEWLINE from beginning to end minutely just as it happened  NEWLINE how he had seen priscilla and how he had sped in his courtship  NEWLINE only smoothing a little and softening down her refusal  NEWLINE but when he came at length to the words priscilla had spoken  NEWLINE words so tender and cruel why do not you speak for yourself john  NEWLINE up leaped the captain of plymouth and stamped on the floor till his armor NEWLINE clanged on the wall where it hung with a sound of sinister omen  NEWLINE all his pent up wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion  NEWLINE even as a hand grenade that scatters destruction around it  NEWLINE wildly he shouted and loud john alden you have betrayed me  NEWLINE me miles standish your friend have supplanted defrauded betrayed me  NEWLINE one of my ancestors ran his sword through the heart of wat tyler  NEWLINE who shall prevent me from running my own through the heart of a traitor  NEWLINE yours is the greater treason for yours is a treason to friendship  NEWLINE you who lived under my roof whom i cherished and loved as a brother  NEWLINE you who have fed at my board and drunk at my cup to whose keeping NEWLINE i have intrusted my honor my thoughts the most sacred and secret — NEWLINE you too brutus ah woe to the name of friendship hereafter  NEWLINE brutus was caesar s friend and you were mine but henceforward NEWLINE let there be nothing between us save war and implacable hatred  NEWLINE so spake the captain of plymouth and strode about in the chamber  NEWLINE chafing and choking with rage like cords were the veins on his temples  NEWLINE but in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway  NEWLINE bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance  NEWLINE rumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of indians  NEWLINE straightway the captain paused and without further question or parley  NEWLINE took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron  NEWLINE buckled the belt round his waist and frowning fiercely departed  NEWLINE alden was left alone he heard the clank of the scabbard NEWLINE growing fainter and fainter and dying away in the distance  NEWLINE then he arose from his seat and looked forth into the darkness  NEWLINE felt the cool air blow on his cheek that was hot with the insult  NEWLINE lifted his eyes to the heavens and folding his hands as in childhood  NEWLINE prayed in the silence of night to the father who seeth in secret  NEWLINE meanwhile the choleric captain strode wrathful away to the council  NEWLINE found it already assembled impatiently waiting his coming  NEWLINE men in the middle of life austere and grave in deportment  NEWLINE only one of them old the hill that was nearest to heaven  NEWLINE covered with snow but erect the excellent elder of plymouth  NEWLINE god had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting  NEWLINE then had sifted the wheat as the living seed of a nation  NEWLINE so say the chronicles old and such is the faith of the people  NEWLINE near them was standing an indian in attitude stern and defiant  NEWLINE naked down to the waist and grim and ferocious in aspect  NEWLINE while on the table before them was lying unopened a bible  NEWLINE ponderous bound in leather brass studded printed in holland  NEWLINE and beside it outstretched the skin of a rattle snake glittered  NEWLINE filled like a quiver with arrows a signal and challenge of warfare  NEWLINE brought by the indian and speaking with arrowy tongues of defiance  NEWLINE this miles standish beheld as he entered and heard them debating NEWLINE what were an answer befitting the hostile message and menace  NEWLINE talking of this and of that contriving suggesting objecting  NEWLINE one voice only for peace and that the voice of the elder  NEWLINE judging it wise and well that some at least were converted  NEWLINE rather than any were slain for this was but christian behavior  NEWLINE then out spake miles standish the stalwart captain of plymouth  NEWLINE muttering deep in his throat for his voice was husky with anger  NEWLINE  what do you mean to make war with milk and the water of roses  NEWLINE is it to shoot red squirrels you have your howitzer planted NEWLINE there on the roof of the church or is it to shoot red devils  NEWLINE truly the only tongue that is understood by a savage NEWLINE must be the tongue of fire that speaks from the mouth of the cannon  NEWLINE thereupon answered and said the excellent elder of plymouth  NEWLINE somewhat amazed and alarmed at this irreverent language  NEWLINE  not so thought saint paul nor yet the other apostles  NEWLINE not from the cannon s mouth were the tongues of fire they spake with  NEWLINE but unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the captain  NEWLINE who had advanced to the table and thus continued discoursing  NEWLINE  leave this matter to me for to me by right it pertaineth  NEWLINE war is a terrible trade but in the because that is righteous  NEWLINE sweet is the smell of powder and thus i answer the challenge  NEWLINE then from the rattlesnake s skin with a sudden contemptuous gesture  NEWLINE jerking the indian arrows he filled it with powder and bullets NEWLINE full to the very jaws and handed it back to the savage  NEWLINE saying in thundering tones here take it this is your answer  NEWLINE silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage  NEWLINE bearing the serpent s skin and seeming himself like a serpent  NEWLINE winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest  NEWLINE v NEWLINE the sailing of the may flower NEWLINE just in the gray of the dawn as the mists uprose from the meadows  NEWLINE there was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of plymouth  NEWLINE clanging and clicking of arms and the order imperative forward  NEWLINE given in tone suppressed a tramp of feet and then silence  NEWLINE figures ten in the mist marched slowly out of the village  NEWLINE standish the stalwart it was with eight of his valorous army  NEWLINE led by their indian guide by hobomok friend of the white men  NEWLINE northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage  NEWLINE giants they seemed in the mist or the mighty men of king david  NEWLINE giants in heart they were who believed in god and the bible — NEWLINE ay who believed in the smiting of midianites and philistines  NEWLINE over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning  NEWLINE under them loud on the sands the serried billows advancing  NEWLINE fired along the line and in regular order retreated  NEWLINE many a mile had they marched when at length the village of plymouth NEWLINE woke from its sleep and arose intent on its manifold labors  NEWLINE sweet was the air and soft and slowly the smoke from the chimneys NEWLINE rose over roofs of thatch and pointed steadily eastward  NEWLINE men came forth from the doors and paused and talked of the weather  NEWLINE said that the wind had changed and was blowing fair for the mayflower  NEWLINE talked of their captain s departure and all the dangers that menaced  NEWLINE he being gone the town and what should be done in his absence  NEWLINE merrily sang the birds and the tender voices of women NEWLINE consecrated with hymns the common cares of the household  NEWLINE out of the sea rose the sun and the billows rejoiced at his coming  NEWLINE beautiful were his feet on the purple tops of the mountains  NEWLINE beautiful on the sails of the mayflower riding at anchor  NEWLINE battered and blackened and worn by all the storms of the winter  NEWLINE loosely against her masts was hanging and flapping her canvas  NEWLINE rent by so many gales and patched by the hands of the sailors  NEWLINE suddenly from her side as the sun rose over the ocean  NEWLINE darted a puff of smoke and floated seaward anon rang NEWLINE loud over field and forest the cannon s roar and the echoes NEWLINE heard and repeated the sound the signal gun of departure  NEWLINE ah but with louder echoes replied the hearts of the people  NEWLINE meekly in voices subdued the chapter was read from the bible  NEWLINE meekly the prayer was begun but ended in fervent entreaty  NEWLINE then from their houses in haste came forth the pilgrims of plymouth  NEWLINE men and women and children all hurrying down to the sea shore  NEWLINE eager with tearful eyes to say farewell to the mayflower  NEWLINE homeward bound over the sea and leaving them here in the desert  NEWLINE foremost among them was alden all night he had lain without slumber  NEWLINE turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever  NEWLINE he had beheld miles standish who came back late from the council  NEWLINE stalking into the room and heard him mutter and murmur  NEWLINE sometimes it seemed a prayer and sometimes it sounded like swearing  NEWLINE once he had come to the bed and stood there a moment in silence  NEWLINE then he had turned away and said i will not awake him  NEWLINE let him sleep on it is best for what is the use of more talking  NEWLINE then he extinguished the light and threw himself down on his pallet  NEWLINE dressed as he was and ready to start at the break of the morning — NEWLINE covered himself with the cloak he had worn in his campaigns in flanders — NEWLINE slept as a soldier sleeps in his bivouac ready for action  NEWLINE but with the dawn he arose in the twilight alden beheld him NEWLINE put on his corselet of steel and all the rest of his armor  NEWLINE buckle about his waist his trusty blade of damascus  NEWLINE take from the corner his musket and so stride out of the chamber  NEWLINE often the heart of the youth had burned and yearned to embrace him  NEWLINE often his lips had essayed to speak imploring for pardon  NEWLINE all the old friendship came back with its tender and grateful emotions  NEWLINE but his pride overmastered the nobler nature within him — NEWLINE pride and the sense of his wrong and the burning fire of the insult  NEWLINE so he beheld his friend departing in anger but spake not  NEWLINE saw him go forth to danger perhaps to death and he spake not  NEWLINE then he arose from his bed and heard what the people were saying  NEWLINE joined in the talk at the door with stephen and richard and gilbert  NEWLINE joined in the morning prayer and in the reading of scripture  NEWLINE and with the others in haste went hurrying down to the sea shore  NEWLINE down to the plymouth rock that had been to their feet as a door step NEWLINE into a world unknown the corner stone of a nation  NEWLINE there with his boat was the master already a little impatient NEWLINE lest he should lose the tide or the wind might shift to the eastward  NEWLINE square built hearty and strong with an odor of ocean about him  NEWLINE speaking with this one and that and cramming letters and parcels NEWLINE into his pockets capacious and messages mingled together NEWLINE into his narrow brain till at last he was wholly bewildered  NEWLINE nearer the boat stood alden with one foot placed on the gunwale  NEWLINE one still firm on the rock and talking at times with the sailors  NEWLINE seated erect on the thwarts all ready and eager for starting  NEWLINE he too was eager to go and thus put an end to his anguish  NEWLINE thinking to fly from despair that swifter than keel is or canvas  NEWLINE thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him  NEWLINE but as he gazed on the crowd he beheld the form of priscilla NEWLINE standing dejected among them unconscious of all that was passing  NEWLINE fixed were her eyes upon his as if she divined his intention  NEWLINE fixed with a look so sad so reproachful imploring and patient  NEWLINE that with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose  NEWLINE as from the verge of a crag where one step more is destruction  NEWLINE strange is the heart of man with its quick mysterious instincts  NEWLINE strange is the life of man and fatal or fated are moments  NEWLINE whereupon turn as on hinges the gates of the wall adamantine  NEWLINE  here i remain he exclaimed as he looked at the heavens above him  NEWLINE thanking the lord whose breath had scattered the mist and the madness  NEWLINE wherein blind and lost to death he was staggering headlong  NEWLINE  yonder snow white cloud that floats in the ether above me  NEWLINE seems like a hand that is pointing and beckoning over the ocean  NEWLINE there is another hand that is not so spectral and ghost like  NEWLINE holding me drawing me back and clasping mine for protection  NEWLINE float o hand of cloud and vanish away in the ether  NEWLINE roll thyself up like a fist to threaten and daunt me i heed not NEWLINE either your warning or menace or any omen of evil  NEWLINE there is no land so sacred no air so pure and so wholesome  NEWLINE as is the air she breathes and the soil that is pressed by her footsteps  NEWLINE here for her sake will i stay and like an invisible presence NEWLINE hover around her for ever protecting supporting her weakness  NEWLINE yes as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the landing  NEWLINE so with the blessing of god shall it be the last at the leaving  NEWLINE meanwhile the master alert but with dignified air and important  NEWLINE scanning with watchful eye the tide and the wind and the weather  NEWLINE walked about on the sands and the people crowded around him NEWLINE saying a few last words and enforcing his careful remembrance  NEWLINE then taking each by the hand as if he were grasping a tiller  NEWLINE into the boat he sprang and in haste shoved off to his vessel  NEWLINE glad in his heart to get rid of all this worry and flurry  NEWLINE glad to be gone from a land of sand and sickness and sorrow  NEWLINE short allowance of victual and plenty of nothing but gospel  NEWLINE lost in the sound of the oars was the last farewell of the pilgrims  NEWLINE o strong hearts and true not one went back in the mayflower  NEWLINE no not one looked back who had set his hand to this ploughing  NEWLINE soon were heard on board the shouts and songs of the sailors NEWLINE heaving the windlass round and hoisting the ponderous anchor  NEWLINE then the yards were braced and all sails set to the west wind  NEWLINE blowing steady and strong and the mayflower sailed from the harbor  NEWLINE rounded the point of the gurnet and leaving far to the southward NEWLINE island and cape of sand and the field of the first encounter  NEWLINE took the wind on her quarter and stood for the open atlantic  NEWLINE borne on the send of the sea and the swelling hearts of the pilgrims  NEWLINE long in silence they watched the receding sail of the vessel  NEWLINE much endeared to them all as something living and human  NEWLINE then as if filled with the spirit and wrapt in a vision prophetic  NEWLINE baring his hoary head the excellent elder of plymouth NEWLINE said let us pray and they prayed and thanked the lord and took courage  NEWLINE mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock and above them NEWLINE bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death and their kindred NEWLINE seemed to awake in their graves and to join in the prayer that they uttered  NEWLINE sun illumined and white on the eastern verge of the ocean NEWLINE gleamed the departing sail like a marble slab in a graveyard  NEWLINE buried beneath it lay for ever all hope of escaping  NEWLINE lo as they turned to depart they saw the form of an indian  NEWLINE watching them from the hill but while they spake with each other  NEWLINE pointing with outstretched hands and saying look he had vanished  NEWLINE so they returned to their homes but alden lingered a little  NEWLINE musing alone on the shore and watching the wash of the billows NEWLINE round the base of the rock and the sparkle and flash of the sunshine  NEWLINE like the spirit of god moving visibly over the waters  NEWLINE vi NEWLINE priscilla NEWLINE thus for a while he stood and mused by the shore of the ocean  NEWLINE thinking of many things and most of all of priscilla  NEWLINE and as if thought had the power to draw to itself like the loadstone  NEWLINE whatsoever it touches by subtile laws of its nature  NEWLINE lo as he turned to depart priscilla was standing beside him  NEWLINE  are you so much offended you will not speak to me said she  NEWLINE  am i so much to blame that yesterday when you were pleading NEWLINE warmly the because of another my heart impulsive and wayward  NEWLINE pleaded your own and spake out forgetful perhaps of decorum  NEWLINE certainly you can forgive me for speaking so frankly for saying NEWLINE what i ought not to have said yet now i can never unsay it  NEWLINE for there are moments in life when the heart is so full of emotion  NEWLINE that if by chance it be shaken or into its depths like a pebble NEWLINE drops some careless word it overflows and its secret  NEWLINE spilt on the ground like water can never be gathered together  NEWLINE yesterday i was shocked when i heard you speak of miles standish  NEWLINE praising his virtues transforming his very defects into virtues  NEWLINE praising his courage and strength and even his fighting in flanders  NEWLINE as if by fighting alone you could win the heart of a woman  NEWLINE quite overlooking yourself and the rest in exalting your hero  NEWLINE therefore i spake as i did by an irresistible impulse  NEWLINE you will forgive me i hope for the sake of the friendship between us  NEWLINE which is too true and too sacred to be so easily broken  NEWLINE thereupon answered john alden the scholar the friend of miles standish  NEWLINE  i was not angry with you with myself alone i was angry  NEWLINE seeing how badly i managed the matter i had in my keeping  NEWLINE  no interrupted the maiden with answer prompt and decisive  NEWLINE  no you were angry with me for speaking so frankly and freely  NEWLINE it was wrong i acknowledge for it is the fate of a woman NEWLINE long to be patient and silent to wait like a ghost that is speechless  NEWLINE till some questioning voice dissolves the spell of its silence  NEWLINE hence is the inner life of so many suffering women NEWLINE sunless and silent and deep like subterranean rivers NEWLINE running through caverns of darkness unheard unseen and unfruitful  NEWLINE chafing their channels of stone with endless and profitless murmurs  NEWLINE thereupon answered john alden the young man the lover of women  NEWLINE  heaven forbid it priscilla and truly they seem to me always NEWLINE more like the beautiful rivers that watered the garden of eden  NEWLINE more like the river euphrates through deserts of havilah flowing  NEWLINE filling the land with delight and memories sweet of the garden  NEWLINE  ah by these words i can see again interrupted the maiden  NEWLINE  how very little you prize me or care for what i am saying  NEWLINE when from the depths of my heart in pain and with secret misgiving  NEWLINE frankly i speak to you asking for sympathy only and kindness  NEWLINE straightway you take up my words that are plain and direct and in earnest  NEWLINE turn them away from their meaning and answer with flattering phrases  NEWLINE this is not right is not just is not true to the best that is in you  NEWLINE for i know and esteem you and feel that your nature is noble  NEWLINE lifting mine up to a higher a more ethereal level  NEWLINE therefore i value your friendship and feel it perhaps the more keenly NEWLINE if you say aught that implies i am only as one among many  NEWLINE if you make use of those common and complimentary phrases NEWLINE most men think so fine in dealing and speaking with women  NEWLINE but which women reject as insipid if not as insulting  NEWLINE mute and amazed was alden and listened and looked at priscilla  NEWLINE thinking he never had seen her more fair more divine in her beauty  NEWLINE he who but yesterday pleaded so glibly the because of another  NEWLINE stood there embarrassed and silent and seeking in vain for an answer  NEWLINE so the maiden went on and little divined or imagined NEWLINE what was at work in his heart that made him so awkward and speechless  NEWLINE  let us then be what we are and speak what we think and in all things NEWLINE keep ourselves loyal to truth and the sacred professions of friendship  NEWLINE it is no secret i tell you nor am i ashamed to declare it  NEWLINE i have liked to be with you to see you to speak with you always  NEWLINE so i was hurt at your words and a little affronted to hear you NEWLINE urge me to marry your friend though he were the captain miles standish  NEWLINE for i must tell you the truth much more to me is your friendship NEWLINE than all the love he could give were he twice the hero you think him  NEWLINE then she extended her hand and alden who eagerly grasped it  NEWLINE felt all the wounds in his heart that were aching and bleeding so sorely  NEWLINE healed by the touch of that hand and he said with a voice full of feeling  NEWLINE  yes we must ever be friends and of all who offer you friendship NEWLINE let me be ever the first the truest the nearest and dearest  NEWLINE casting a farewell look at the glimmering sail of the mayflower  NEWLINE distant but still in sight and sinking below the horizon  NEWLINE homeward together they walked with a strange indefinite feeling  NEWLINE that all the rest had departed and left them alone in the desert  NEWLINE but as they went through the fields in the blessing and smile of the sunshine  NEWLINE lighter grew their hearts and priscilla said very archly  NEWLINE  now that our terrible captain has gone in pursuit of the indians  NEWLINE where he is happier far than he would be commanding a household  NEWLINE you may speak boldly and tell me of all that happened between you  NEWLINE when you returned last night and said how ungrateful you found me  NEWLINE thereupon answered john alden and told her the whole of the story — NEWLINE told her his own despair and the direful wrath of miles standish  NEWLINE whereat the maiden smiled and said between laughing and earnest  NEWLINE  he is a little chimney and heated hot in a moment  NEWLINE but as he gently rebuked her and told her how much he had suffered — NEWLINE how he had even determined to sail that day in the mayflower  NEWLINE and had remained for her sake on hearing the dangers that threatened — NEWLINE all her manner was changed and she said with a faltering accent  NEWLINE  truly i thank you for this how good you have been to me always  NEWLINE thus as a pilgrim devout who toward jerusalem journeys  NEWLINE taking three steps in advance and one reluctantly backward  NEWLINE urged by importunate zeal and withheld by pangs of contrition  NEWLINE slowly but steadily onward receding yet ever advancing  NEWLINE journeyed this puritan youth to the holy land of his longings  NEWLINE urged by the fervor of love and withheld by remorseful misgivings  NEWLINE vii NEWLINE the march of miles standish NEWLINE meanwhile the stalwart miles standish was marching steadily northward  NEWLINE winding through forest and swamp and along the trend of the sea shore  NEWLINE all day long with hardly a halt the fire of his anger NEWLINE burning and crackling within and the sulphurous odor of powder NEWLINE seeming more sweet to his nostrils than all the scents of the forest  NEWLINE silent and moody he went and much he revolved his discomfort  NEWLINE he who was used to success and to easy victories always  NEWLINE thus to be flouted rejected and laughed to scorn by a maiden  NEWLINE thus to be mocked and betrayed by the friend whom most he had trusted  NEWLINE ah t was too much to be borne and he fretted and chafed in his armor  NEWLINE  i alone am to blame he muttered for mine was the folly  NEWLINE what has a rough old soldier grown grim and gray in the harness  NEWLINE used to the camp and its ways to do with the wooing of maidens  NEWLINE  t was but a dream let it pass let it vanish like so many others  NEWLINE what i thought was a flower is only a weed and is worthless  NEWLINE out of my heart will i pluck it and throw it away and henceforward NEWLINE be but a fighter of battles a lover and wooer of dangers  NEWLINE thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort  NEWLINE while he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest  NEWLINE looking up at the trees and the constellations beyond them  NEWLINE after a three days march he came to an indian encampment NEWLINE pitched on the edge of a meadow between the sea and the forest  NEWLINE women at work by the tents and the warriors horrid with war paint  NEWLINE seated about a fire and smoking and talking together  NEWLINE who when they saw from afar the sudden approach of the white men  NEWLINE saw the flash of the sun on breastplate and sabre and musket  NEWLINE straightway leaped to their feet and two from among them advancing  NEWLINE came to parley with standish and offer him furs as a present  NEWLINE friendship was in their looks but in their hearts there was hatred  NEWLINE braves of the tribe were these and brothers gigantic in stature  NEWLINE huge as goliath of gath or the terrible og king of bashan  NEWLINE one was pecksuot named and the other was called wattawamat  NEWLINE round their necks were suspended their knives in scabbards of wampum  NEWLINE two edged trenchant knives with points as sharp as a needle  NEWLINE other arms had they none for they were cunning and crafty  NEWLINE  welcome english they said these words they had learned from the traders NEWLINE touching at times on the coast to barter and chaffer for peltries  NEWLINE then in their native tongue they began to parley with standish  NEWLINE through his guide and interpreter hobomok friend of the white man  NEWLINE begging for blankets and knives but mostly for muskets and powder  NEWLINE kept by the white man they said concealed with the plague in his cellars  NEWLINE ready to be let loose and destroy his brother the red man  NEWLINE but when standish refused and said he would give them the bible  NEWLINE suddenly changing their tone they began to boast and to bluster  NEWLINE then wattawamat advanced with a stride in front of the other  NEWLINE and with a lofty demeanor thus vauntingly spake to the captain  NEWLINE  now wattawamat can see by the fiery eyes of the captain  NEWLINE angry is he in his heart but the heart of the brave wattawamat NEWLINE is not afraid at the sight he was not born of a woman  NEWLINE but on a mountain at night from an oak tree riven by lightning  NEWLINE forth he sprang at a bound with all his weapons about him  NEWLINE shouting who is there here to fight with the brave wattawamat  NEWLINE then he unsheathed his knife and whetting the blade on his left hand  NEWLINE held it aloft and displayed a woman s face on the handle  NEWLINE saying with bitter expression and look of sinister meaning  NEWLINE  i have another at home with the face of a man on the handle  NEWLINE by and by they shall marry and there will be plenty of children  NEWLINE then stood pecksuot forth self vaunting insulting miles standish  NEWLINE while with his fingers he petted the knife that hung at his bosom  NEWLINE drawing it half from its sheath and plunging it back as he muttered  NEWLINE  by and by it shall see it shall eat ah ha but shall speak not  NEWLINE this is the mighty captain the white men have sent to destroy us  NEWLINE he is a little man let him go and work with the women  NEWLINE meanwhile standish had noted the faces and figures of indians NEWLINE peeping and creeping about from bush to tree in the forest  NEWLINE feigning to look for game with arrows set on their bow strings  NEWLINE drawing about him still closer and closer the net of their ambush  NEWLINE but undaunted he stood and dissembled and treated them smoothly  NEWLINE so the old chronicles say that were writ in the days of the fathers  NEWLINE but when he heard their defiance the boast the taunt and the insult  NEWLINE all the hot blood of his race of sir hugh and of thurston de standish  NEWLINE boiled and beat in his heart and swelled in the veins of his temples  NEWLINE headlong he leaped on the boaster and snatching his knife from its scabbard  NEWLINE plunged it into his heart and reeling backward the savage NEWLINE fell with his face to the sky and a fiendlike fierceness upon it  NEWLINE straight there arose from the forest the awful sound of the war whoop  NEWLINE and like a flurry of snow on the whistling wind of december  NEWLINE swift and sudden and keen came a flight of feathery arrows  NEWLINE then came a cloud of smoke and out of the cloud came the lightning  NEWLINE out of the lightning thunder and death unseen ran before it  NEWLINE frightened the savages fled for shelter in swamp and in thicket  NEWLINE hotly pursued and beset but their sachem the brave wattawamat  NEWLINE fled not he was dead unswerving and swift had a bullet NEWLINE passed through his brain and he fell with both hands clutching the greensward  NEWLINE seeming in death to hold back from his foe the land of his fathers  NEWLINE there on the flowers of the meadow the warriors lay and above them  NEWLINE silent with folded arms stood hobomok friend of the white man  NEWLINE smiling at length he exclaimed to the stalwart captain of plymouth  NEWLINE  pecksuot bragged very loud of his courage his strength and his stature — NEWLINE mocked the great captain and called him a little man but i see now NEWLINE big enough have you been to lay him speechless before you  NEWLINE thus the first battle was fought and won by the stalwart miles standish  NEWLINE when the tidings thereof were brought to the village of plymouth  NEWLINE and as a trophy of war the head of the brave wattawamat NEWLINE scowled from the roof of the fort which at once was a church and a fortress  NEWLINE all who beheld it rejoiced and praised the lord and took courage  NEWLINE only priscilla averted her face from this spectre of terror  NEWLINE thanking god in her heart that she had not married miles standish  NEWLINE shrinking fearing almost lest coming home from his battles  NEWLINE he should lay claim to her hand as the prize and reward of his valor  NEWLINE viii NEWLINE the spinning wheel NEWLINE month after month passed away and in autumn the ships of the merchants NEWLINE came with kindred and friends with cattle and corn for the pilgrims  NEWLINE all in the village was peace the men were intent on their labors  NEWLINE busy with hewing and building with garden plot and with merestead  NEWLINE busy with breaking the glebe and mowing the grass in the meadows  NEWLINE searching the sea for its fish and hunting the deer in the forest  NEWLINE all in the village was peace but at times the rumor of warfare NEWLINE filled the air with alarm and the apprehension of danger  NEWLINE bravely the stalwart miles standish was scouring the land with his forces  NEWLINE waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies  NEWLINE till his name had become a sound of fear to the nations  NEWLINE anger was still in his heart but at times the remorse and contrition NEWLINE which in all noble natures succeed the passionate outbreak  NEWLINE came like a rising tide that encounters the rush of a river  NEWLINE staying its current awhile but making it bitter and brackish  NEWLINE meanwhile alden at home had built him a new habitation  NEWLINE solid substantial of timber rough hewn from the firs of the forest  NEWLINE wooden barred was the door and the roof was covered with rushes  NEWLINE latticed the windows were and the window panes were of paper  NEWLINE oiled to admit the light while wind and rain were excluded  NEWLINE there too he dug a well and around it planted an orchard  NEWLINE still may be seen to this day some trace of the well and the orchard  NEWLINE close to the house was the stall where safe and secure from annoyance  NEWLINE raghorn the snow white steer that had fallen to alden s allotment NEWLINE in the division of cattle might ruminate in the night time NEWLINE over the pastures he cropped made fragrant by sweet pennyroyal  NEWLINE oft when his labor was finished with eager feet would the dreamer NEWLINE follow the pathway that ran through the woods to the house of priscilla  NEWLINE led by illusions romantic and subtile deceptions of fancy  NEWLINE pleasure disguised as duty and love in the semblance of friendship  NEWLINE ever of her he thought when he fashioned the walls of his dwelling  NEWLINE ever of her he thought when he delved in the soil of his garden  NEWLINE ever of her he thought when he read in his bible on sunday NEWLINE praise of the virtuous woman as she is described in the proverbs — NEWLINE how the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her always  NEWLINE how all the days of her life she will do him good and not evil  NEWLINE how she seeketh the wool and the flax and worketh with gladness  NEWLINE how she layeth her hand to the spindle and holdeth the distaff  NEWLINE how she is not afraid of the snow for herself or her household  NEWLINE knowing her household are clothed with the scarlet cloth of her weaving  NEWLINE so as she sat at her wheel one afternoon in the autumn  NEWLINE alden who opposite sat and was watching her dexterous fingers  NEWLINE as if the thread she was spinning were that of his life and his fortune  NEWLINE after a pause in their talk thus spake to the sound of the spindle  NEWLINE  truly priscilla he said when i see you spinning and spinning  NEWLINE never idle a moment but thrifty and thoughtful of others  NEWLINE suddenly you are transformed are visibly changed in a moment  NEWLINE you are no longer priscilla but bertha the beautiful spinner  NEWLINE here the light foot on the treadle grew swifter and swifter the spindle NEWLINE uttered an angry snarl and the thread snapped short in her fingers  NEWLINE while the impetuous speaker not heeding the mischief continued  NEWLINE  you are the beautiful bertha the spinner the queen of helvetia  NEWLINE she whose story i read at a stall in the streets of southampton  NEWLINE who as she rode on her palfrey over valley and meadow and mountain  NEWLINE ever was spinning her thread from a distaff fixed to her saddle  NEWLINE she was so thrifty and good that her name passed into a proverb  NEWLINE so shall it be with your own when the spinning wheel shall no longer NEWLINE hum in the house of the farmer and fill its chambers with music  NEWLINE then shall the mothers reproving relate how it was in their childhood  NEWLINE praising the good old times and the days of priscilla the spinner  NEWLINE straight uprose from her wheel the beautiful puritan maiden  NEWLINE pleased with the praise of her thrift from him whose praise was the sweetest  NEWLINE drew from the reel on the table a snowy skein of her spinning  NEWLINE thus making answer meanwhile to the flattering phrases of alden  NEWLINE  come you must not be idle if i am a pattern for housewives  NEWLINE show yourself equally worthy of being the model of husbands  NEWLINE hold this skein on your hands while i wind it ready for knitting  NEWLINE then who knows but hereafter when fashions have changed and the manners  NEWLINE fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of john alden  NEWLINE thus with a jest and a laugh the skein on his hands she adjusted  NEWLINE he sitting awkwardly there with his arms extended before him  NEWLINE she standing graceful erect and winding the thread from his fingers  NEWLINE sometimes chiding a little his clumsy manner of holding  NEWLINE sometimes touching his hands as she disentangled expertly NEWLINE twist or knot in the yarn unawares for how could she help it — NEWLINE sending electrical thrills through every nerve in his body  NEWLINE lo in the midst of this scene a breathless messenger entered  NEWLINE bringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village  NEWLINE yes miles standish was dead an indian had brought them the tidings — NEWLINE slain by a poisoned arrow shot down in the front of the battle  NEWLINE into an ambush beguiled cut off with the whole of his forces  NEWLINE all the town would be burned and all the people be murdered  NEWLINE such were the tidings of evil that burst on the hearts of the hearers  NEWLINE silent and statue like stood priscilla her face looking backward NEWLINE still at the face of the speaker her arms uplifted in horror  NEWLINE but john alden upstarting as if the barb of the arrow NEWLINE piercing the heart of his friend had struck his own and had sundered NEWLINE once and for ever the bonds that held him bound as a captive  NEWLINE wild with excess of sensation the awful delight of his freedom  NEWLINE mingled with pain and regret unconscious of what he was doing  NEWLINE clasped almost with a groan the motionless form of priscilla  NEWLINE pressing her close to his heart as for ever his own and exclaiming  NEWLINE  those whom the lord hath united let no man put them asunder  NEWLINE even as rivulets twain from distant and separate sources  NEWLINE seeing each other afar as they leap from the rocks and pursuing NEWLINE each one its devious path but drawing nearer and nearer  NEWLINE rush together at last at their trysting place in the forest  NEWLINE so these lives that had run thus far in separate channels  NEWLINE coming in sight of each other then swerving and flowing asunder  NEWLINE parted by barriers strong but drawing nearer and nearer  NEWLINE rushed together at last and one was lost in the other  NEWLINE ix NEWLINE the wedding day NEWLINE forth from the curtain of clouds from the tent of purple and scarlet  NEWLINE issued the sun the great high priest in his garments resplendent  NEWLINE holiness unto the lord in letters of light on his forehead  NEWLINE round the hem of his robe the golden bells and pomegranates  NEWLINE blessing the world he came and the bars of vapor beneath him NEWLINE gleamed like a grate of brass and the sea at his feet was a laver  NEWLINE this was the wedding morn of priscilla the puritan maiden  NEWLINE friends were assembled together the elder and magistrate also NEWLINE graced the scene with their presence and stood like the law and the gospel  NEWLINE one with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven  NEWLINE simple and brief was the wedding as that of ruth and of boaz  NEWLINE softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal  NEWLINE taking each other for husband and wife in the magistrate s presence  NEWLINE after the puritan way and the laudable custom of holland  NEWLINE fervently then and devoutly the excellent elder of plymouth NEWLINE prayed for the hearth and the home that were founded that day in affection  NEWLINE speaking of life and of death and imploring divine benedictions  NEWLINE lo when the service was ended a form appeared on the threshold  NEWLINE clad in armor of steel a sombre and sorrowful figure  NEWLINE why does the bridegroom start and stare at the strange apparition  NEWLINE why does the bride turn pale and hide her face on his shoulder  NEWLINE is it a phantom of air a bodiless spectral illusion  NEWLINE is it a ghost from the grave that has come to forbid the betrothal  NEWLINE long had it stood there unseen a guest uninvited unwelcomed  NEWLINE over its clouded eyes there had passed at times an expression NEWLINE softening the gloom and revealing the warm heart hidden beneath them  NEWLINE as when across the sky the driving rack of the rain cloud NEWLINE grows for a moment thin and betrays the sun by its brightness  NEWLINE once it had lifted its hand and moved its lips but was silent  NEWLINE as if an iron will had mastered the fleeting intention  NEWLINE but when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction  NEWLINE into the room it strode and the people beheld with amazement NEWLINE bodily there in his armor miles standish the captain of plymouth  NEWLINE grasping the bridegroom s hand he said with emotion forgive me  NEWLINE i have been angry and hurt too long have i cherished the feeling  NEWLINE i have been cruel and hard but now thank god it is ended  NEWLINE mine is the same hot blood that leaped in the veins of hugh standish  NEWLINE sensitive swift to resent but as swift in atoning for error  NEWLINE never so much as now was miles standish the friend of john alden  NEWLINE thereupon answered the bridegroom let all be forgotten between us — NEWLINE all save the dear old friendship and that shall grow older and dearer  NEWLINE then the captain advanced and bowing saluted priscilla  NEWLINE gravely and after the manner of old fashioned gentry in england  NEWLINE something of camp and of court of town and of country commingled  NEWLINE wishing her joy of her wedding and loudly lauding her husband  NEWLINE then he said with a smile i should have remembered the adage — NEWLINE if you would be well served you must serve yourself and moreover  NEWLINE no man can gather cherries in kent at the season of christmas  NEWLINE great was the people s amazement and greater yet their rejoicing  NEWLINE thus to behold once more the sun burnt face of their captain  NEWLINE whom they had mourned as dead and they gathered and crowded about him  NEWLINE eager to see him and hear him forgetful of bride and of bridegroom  NEWLINE questioning answering laughing and each interrupting the other  NEWLINE till the good captain declared being quite overpowered and bewildered  NEWLINE he had rather by far break into an indian encampment  NEWLINE than come again to a wedding to which he had not been invited  NEWLINE meanwhile the bridegroom went forth and stood with the bride at the doorway  NEWLINE breathing the perfumed air of that warm and beautiful morning  NEWLINE touched with autumnal tints but lonely and sad in the sunshine  NEWLINE lay extended before them the land of toil and privation  NEWLINE there were the graves of the dead and the barren waste of the sea shore  NEWLINE there the familiar fields the groves of pine and the meadows  NEWLINE but to their eyes transfigured it seemed as the garden of eden  NEWLINE filled with the presence of god whose voice was the sound of the ocean  NEWLINE soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure  NEWLINE friends coming forth from the house and impatient of longer delaying  NEWLINE each with his plan for the day and the work that was left uncompleted  NEWLINE then from a stall near at hand amid exclamations of wonder  NEWLINE alden the thoughtful the careful so happy so proud of priscilla  NEWLINE brought out his snow white steer obeying the hand of its master  NEWLINE led by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils  NEWLINE covered with crimson cloth and a cushion placed for a saddle  NEWLINE she should not walk he said through the dust and heat of the noonday  NEWLINE nay she should ride like a queen not plod along like a peasant  NEWLINE somewhat alarmed at first but reassured by the others  NEWLINE placing her hand on the cushion her foot in the hand of her husband  NEWLINE gayly with joyous laugh priscilla mounted her palfrey  NEWLINE  nothing is wanting now he said with a smile but the distaff  NEWLINE then you would be in truth my queen my beautiful bertha  NEWLINE onward the bridal procession now moved to their new habitation  NEWLINE happy husband and wife and friends conversing together  NEWLINE pleasantly murmured the brook as they crossed the ford in the forest  NEWLINE pleased with the image that passed like a dream of love through its bosom  NEWLINE tremulous floating in air over the depths of the azure abysses  NEWLINE down through the golden leaves the sun was pouring his splendors  NEWLINE gleaming on purple grapes that from branches above them suspended  NEWLINE mingled their odorous breath with the balm of the pine and the fir tree  NEWLINE wild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of eshcol  NEWLINE like a picture it seemed of the primitive pastoral ages  NEWLINE fresh with the youth of the world and recalling rebecca and isaac  NEWLINE old and yet ever new and simple and beautiful always  NEWLINE love immortal and young in the endless succession of lovers  NEWLINE so through the plymouth woods passed onward the bridal procession \n",

NEWLINE sunny days may likewise be foretold  NEWLINE by the sharp twinkle of the stars the moon NEWLINE rising to face her brother’s rays by day  NEWLINE no tenuous fleeces blowing in the sky  NEWLINE no halcyons sea favorites on the shore NEWLINE stretching out their wings in tepid sunlight  NEWLINE but mists go lower and lie on the fields  NEWLINE the owl observing sundown from his perch  NEWLINE modulates his meaningless melancholy  NEWLINE aloft in crystal air the sparrow hawk NEWLINE chases his prey and as she flits aside NEWLINE the fierce hawk follows screaming on the wind  NEWLINE and as he swoops she flits aside again  NEWLINE with funereal contractions of the windpipe NEWLINE the crows produce their caws three at a time  NEWLINE and in their high nests pleased at i know not what  NEWLINE noise it among themselves no doubt rejoicing NEWLINE to see their little brood after the storm  NEWLINE but not i think by reason of divine NEWLINE insight or superior grasp of things  NEWLINE  NEWLINE  NEWLINE viii but if you carefully watch the rapid sun NEWLINE and the moon following a fair night’s snare NEWLINE never deceives you as to next day’s weather  NEWLINE when the new moon collects a rim of light  NEWLINE if that bow be obscured with a dark vapor  NEWLINE then a great tempest is in preparation  NEWLINE if it be blushing like a virgin’s cheek  NEWLINE there will be wind wind makes diana blush  NEWLINE if on the fourth night most significant  NEWLINE she goes pure and unclouded through the sky  NEWLINE all that day and the following days will be  NEWLINE for one full month exempt from rain and wind  NEWLINE the sun too rising and setting in the waves  NEWLINE will give you weather signs trustworthy ones NEWLINE whether at morning or when stars come out  NEWLINE a mackerel sky over the east at sunrise NEWLINE means look out for squalls a gale is coming  NEWLINE unfavorable to trees and plants and flocks  NEWLINE or when through denser strata the sun’s rays NEWLINE break out dimly or aurora rises NEWLINE pale from tithonus’ crocus colored chamber  NEWLINE alas the vine leaf will not shield the cluster NEWLINE in the hubbub of roof pattering bitter hail  NEWLINE it will be well to notice sunset too  NEWLINE for the sun’s visage then has various colors  NEWLINE bluish and dark means rain if it be fiery NEWLINE that means an east wind if it be dappled NEWLINE and mixed with red gold light then you will see NEWLINE wind and rain in commotion everywhere  NEWLINE nobody can advise me on that night  NEWLINE to cast off hawsers and put out to sea  NEWLINE but if the next day passes and the sunset NEWLINE then be clear you need not fear the weather  NEWLINE a bright norther will sway the forest trees  NEWLINE  NEWLINE  NEWLINE ix last what the late dusk brings and whence the fair NEWLINE clouds are blown and secrets of the southwind NEWLINE you may learn from the sun whose prophecies NEWLINE no man denies seeing black insurrections  NEWLINE treacheries and wars are told by him  NEWLINE  NEWLINE when caesar died the great sun pitied rome  NEWLINE so veiling his bright head the godless time NEWLINE trembled in fear of everlasting night  NEWLINE and then were portents given of earth and ocean  NEWLINE vile dogs upon the roads and hideous NEWLINE strange birds and aetna quaking and her fires NEWLINE bursting to overflow the cyclops’ fields NEWLINE with flames whirled in the air and melted stones  NEWLINE thunder of war was heard in germany NEWLINE from south to north shaking the granite alps  NEWLINE and a voice also through the silent groves NEWLINE piercing and apparitions wondrous pale NEWLINE were seen in dead of night then cattle spoke NEWLINE  o horror streams stood still the earth cracked open NEWLINE and tears sprang even from the temple bronze  NEWLINE the po monarch of rivers on his back NEWLINE spuming whole forests raced through the lowland plains NEWLINE and bore off pens and herds and then continually NEWLINE the viscera of beasts were thick with evil  NEWLINE blood trickled from the springs tall towns at night NEWLINE re echoed to the wolf pack’s shivering howl  NEWLINE and never from pure heaven have there fallen NEWLINE so many fires nor baleful comets burned  NEWLINE it seemed that once again the roman lines  NEWLINE alike in arms would fight at philippi  NEWLINE and heaven permitted those thessalian fields NEWLINE to be enriched again with blood of ours  NEWLINE some future day perhaps in that country  NEWLINE a farmer with his plow will turn the ground  NEWLINE and find the javelins eaten thin with rust  NEWLINE or knock the empty helmets with his mattock NEWLINE and wonder digging up those ancient bones  NEWLINE  NEWLINE paternal gods ancestors mother vesta  NEWLINE you that guard tiber and the palatine  NEWLINE now that long century is overthrown  NEWLINE let not this young man fail to give us peace  NEWLINE long enough beneath your rule o caesar  NEWLINE heaven has hated us and all those triumphs NEWLINE where justice was thrown down—so many wars  NEWLINE so many kinds of wickedness no honor NEWLINE rendered the plow but the fields gone to ruin  NEWLINE the country folk made homeless and their scythes NEWLINE beaten to straight swords on the blowing forge  NEWLINE war from the euphrates to germany  NEWLINE ruptured engagements violence of nations  NEWLINE and impious mars raging the whole world over— NEWLINE as when a four horsed chariot rears away NEWLINE plunging from the barrier and runs wild  NEWLINE heedless of the reins or the charioteer  NEWLINE terrorizers of themselves laughers in NEWLINE language and priests of any mystery— NEWLINE not by authority  NEWLINE  NEWLINE what of the revered NEWLINE historian the painstaking public man  NEWLINE his dusty briefcase worn to a splitting bulge  NEWLINE the scholar descending from the library NEWLINE smiles at the doves and at the glowing grass  NEWLINE letters gone frail and yellow in their strings NEWLINE spill fuzz and dust from the stuck folds  NEWLINE it might be inferred from what the ambassador NEWLINE wrote to his daughter in virginia NEWLINE that others were privy to the situation  NEWLINE these judges are gentle and well cultivated NEWLINE honorable stylists penetrating men  NEWLINE mirrors of duplicity and bewilderment  NEWLINE mirrors of magnificent deep rooted structural NEWLINE policy and implacable miscarriage  NEWLINE the documents are all photostated the files NEWLINE arranged let humane logic NEWLINE guide them in the wilderness of the state  NEWLINE the pallid husbandman grunts at his fields  NEWLINE sells his new lambs in the damp of march  NEWLINE thumbs the slick catalogue of the mail order NEWLINE house for ginghams for the girls of summer  NEWLINE chews with the county agent at the gate  NEWLINE he will be ruddy as the sun goes over  NEWLINE the clouds go over the tractor shudders on NEWLINE through the high fields the piling west will grow NEWLINE fractious with lightning the wild branches bend  NEWLINE curtains blow out like goodbye handkerchiefs NEWLINE hilarious in the gloomy wind autumn NEWLINE comes with marriages to the aging house  NEWLINE winter comes with comforts and old death  NEWLINE still the farmer’s dull hand holds the seed  NEWLINE the low star glimmers on the dewy sill \n",
