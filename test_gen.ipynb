NEWLINE beautiful rose of love that bloomed for me by the wayside  NEWLINE she was the first to die of all who came in the mayflower  NEWLINE green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there  NEWLINE better to hide from the indian scouts the graves of our people  NEWLINE lest they should count them and see how many already have perished  NEWLINE sadly his face he averted and strode up and down and was thoughtful  NEWLINE fixed to the opposite wall was a shelf of books and among them NEWLINE prominent three distinguished alike for bulk and for binding  NEWLINE bariffe s artillery guide and the commentaries of caesar  NEWLINE out of the latin translated by arthur goldinge of london  NEWLINE and as if guarded by these between them was standing the bible  NEWLINE musing a moment before them miles standish paused as if doubtful NEWLINE which of the three he should choose for his consolation and comfort  NEWLINE whether the wars of the hebrews the famous campaigns of the romans  NEWLINE or the artillery practice designed for belligerent christians  NEWLINE finally down from its shelf he dragged the ponderous roman  NEWLINE seated himself at the window and opened the book and in silence NEWLINE turned over the well worn leaves where thumb marks thick on the margin  NEWLINE like the trample of feet proclaimed the battle was hottest  NEWLINE nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling  NEWLINE busily writing epistles important to go by the mayflower  NEWLINE ready to sail on the morrow or next day at latest god willing  NEWLINE homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter  NEWLINE letters written by alden and full of the name of priscilla  NEWLINE full of the name and the fame of the puritan maiden priscilla  NEWLINE ii NEWLINE love and friendship NEWLINE nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling  NEWLINE or an occasional sigh from the laboring heart of the captain  NEWLINE reading the marvellous words and achievements of julius caesar  NEWLINE after a while he exclaimed as he smote with his hand palm downwards  NEWLINE heavily on the page a wonderful man was this caesar  NEWLINE you are a writer and i am a fighter but here is a fellow NEWLINE who could both write and fight and in both was equally skilful  NEWLINE straightway answered and spake john alden the comely the youthful  NEWLINE  yes he was equally skilled as you say with his pen and his weapons  NEWLINE somewhere have i read but where i forget he could dictate NEWLINE seven letters at once at the same time writing his memoirs  NEWLINE  truly continued the captain not heeding or hearing the other  NEWLINE  truly a wonderful man was caius julius caesar  NEWLINE better be first he said in a little iberian village  NEWLINE than be second in rome and i think he was right when he said it  NEWLINE twice was he married before he was twenty and many times after  NEWLINE battles five hundred he fought and a thousand cities he conquered  NEWLINE he too fought in flanders as he himself has recorded  NEWLINE finally he was stabbed by his friend the orator brutus  NEWLINE now do you know what he did on a certain occasion in flanders  NEWLINE when the rear guard of his army retreated the front giving way too  NEWLINE and the immortal twelfth legion was crowded so closely together NEWLINE there was no room for their swords why he seized a shield from a soldier  NEWLINE put himself straight at the head of his troops and commanded the captains  NEWLINE calling on each by his name to order forward the ensigns  NEWLINE then to widen the ranks and give more room for their weapons  NEWLINE so he won the day the battle of something or other  NEWLINE that is what i always say if you wish a thing to be well done  NEWLINE you must do it yourself you must not leave it to others  NEWLINE all was silent again the captain continued his reading  NEWLINE nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling NEWLINE writing epistles important to go next day by the mayflower  NEWLINE filled with the name and the fame of the puritan maiden priscilla  NEWLINE every sentence began or closed with the name of priscilla  NEWLINE till the treacherous pen to which he confided the secret  NEWLINE strove to betray it by singing and shouting the name of priscilla  NEWLINE finally closing his book with a bang of the ponderous cover  NEWLINE sudden and loud as the sound of a soldier grounding his musket  NEWLINE thus to the young man spake miles standish the captain of plymouth  NEWLINE  when you have finished your work i have something important to tell you  NEWLINE be not however in haste i can wait i shall not be impatient  NEWLINE straightway alden replied as he folded the last of his letters  NEWLINE pushing his papers aside and giving respectful attention  NEWLINE  speak for whenever you speak i am always ready to listen  NEWLINE always ready to hear whatever pertains to miles standish  NEWLINE thereupon answered the captain embarrassed and culling his phrases  NEWLINE  t is not good for a man to be alone say the scriptures  NEWLINE this i have said before and again and again i repeat it  NEWLINE every hour in the day i think it and feel it and say it  NEWLINE since rose standish died my life has been weary and dreary  NEWLINE sick at heart have i been beyond the healing of friendship  NEWLINE oft in my lonely hours have i thought of the maiden priscilla  NEWLINE she is alone in the world her father and mother and brother NEWLINE died in the winter together i saw her going and coming  NEWLINE now to the grave of the dead and now to the bed of the dying  NEWLINE patient courageous and strong and said to myself that if ever NEWLINE there were angels on earth as there are angels in heaven  NEWLINE two have i seen and known and the angel whose name is priscilla NEWLINE holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned  NEWLINE long have i cherished the thought but never have dared to reveal it  NEWLINE being a coward in this though valiant enough for the most part  NEWLINE go to the damsel priscilla the loveliest maiden of plymouth  NEWLINE say that a blunt old captain a man not of words but of actions  NEWLINE offers his hand and his heart the hand and heart of a soldier  NEWLINE not in these words you know but this in short is my meaning  NEWLINE i am a maker of war and not a maker of phrases  NEWLINE you who are bred as a scholar can say it in elegant language  NEWLINE such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers  NEWLINE such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden  NEWLINE when he had spoken john alden the fair haired taciturn stripling  NEWLINE all aghast at his words surprised embarrassed bewildered  NEWLINE trying to mask his dismay by treating the subject with lightness  NEWLINE trying to smile and yet feeling his heart stand still in his bosom  NEWLINE just as a timepiece stops in a house that is stricken by lightning  NEWLINE thus made answer and spake or rather stammered than answered  NEWLINE  such a message as that i am sure i should mangle and mar it  NEWLINE if you would have it well done i am only repeating your maxim — NEWLINE you must do it yourself you must not leave it to others  NEWLINE but with the air of a man whom nothing can turn from his purpose  NEWLINE gravely shaking his head made answer the captain of plymouth  NEWLINE  truly the maxim is good and i do not mean to gainsay it  NEWLINE but we must use it discreetly and not waste powder for nothing  NEWLINE now as i said before i was never a maker of phrases  NEWLINE i can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender  NEWLINE but march up to a woman with such a proposal i dare not  NEWLINE i am not afraid of bullets nor shot from the mouth of a cannon  NEWLINE but of a thundering no point blank from the mouth of a woman  NEWLINE that i confess i am afraid of nor am i ashamed to confess it  NEWLINE so you must grant my request for you are an elegant scholar  NEWLINE having the graces of speech and skill in the turning of phrases  NEWLINE taking the hand of his friend who still was reluctant and doubtful  NEWLINE holding it long in his own and pressing it kindly he added  NEWLINE  though i have spoken thus lightly yet deep is the feeling that prompts me  NEWLINE surely you cannot refuse what i ask in the name of our friendship  NEWLINE then made answer john alden the name of friendship is sacred  NEWLINE what you demand in that name i have not the power to deny you  NEWLINE so the strong will prevailed subduing and moulding the gentler  NEWLINE friendship prevailed over love and alden went on his errand  NEWLINE iii NEWLINE the lover s errand NEWLINE so the strong will prevailed and alden went on his errand  NEWLINE out of the street of the village and into the paths of the forest  NEWLINE into the tranquil woods where blue birds and robins were building NEWLINE towns in the populous trees with hanging gardens of verdure  NEWLINE peaceful aerial cities of joy and affection and freedom  NEWLINE all around him was calm but within him commotion and conflict  NEWLINE love contending with friendship and self with each generous impulse  NEWLINE to and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing  NEWLINE as in a foundering ship with every roll of the vessel  NEWLINE washes the bitter sea the merciless surge of the ocean  NEWLINE  must i relinquish it all he cried with a wild lamentation  NEWLINE  must i relinquish it all the joy the hope the illusion  NEWLINE was it for this i have loved and waited and worshipped in silence  NEWLINE was it for this i have followed the flying feet and the shadow NEWLINE over the wintry sea to the desolate shores of new england  NEWLINE truly the heart is deceitful and out of its depths of corruption NEWLINE rise like an exhalation the misty phantoms of passion  NEWLINE angels of light they seem but are only delusions of satan  NEWLINE all is clear to me now i feel it i see it distinctly  NEWLINE this is the hand of the lord it is laid upon me in anger  NEWLINE for i have followed too much the heart s desires and devices  NEWLINE worshipping astaroth blindly and impious idols of baal  NEWLINE this is the cross i must bear the sin and the swift retribution  NEWLINE so through the plymouth woods john alden went on his errand  NEWLINE crossing the brook at the ford where it brawled over pebble and shallow  NEWLINE gathering still as he went the may flowers blooming around him  NEWLINE fragrant filling the air with a strange and wonderful sweetness  NEWLINE children lost in the woods and covered with leaves in their slumber  NEWLINE  puritan flowers he said and the type of puritan maidens  NEWLINE modest and simple and sweet the very type of priscilla  NEWLINE so i will take them to her to priscilla the may flower of plymouth  NEWLINE modest and simple and sweet as a parting gift will i take them  NEWLINE breathing their silent farewells as they fade and wither and perish  NEWLINE soon to be thrown away as is the heart of the giver  NEWLINE so through the plymouth woods john alden went on his errand  NEWLINE came to an open space and saw the disk of the ocean  NEWLINE sailless sombre and cold with the comfortless breath of the east wind  NEWLINE saw the new built house and people at work in a meadow  NEWLINE heard as he drew near the door the musical voice of priscilla NEWLINE singing the hundredth psalm the grand old puritan anthem  NEWLINE music that luther sang to the sacred words of the psalmist  NEWLINE full of the breath of the lord consoling and comforting many  NEWLINE then as he opened the door he beheld the form of the maiden NEWLINE seated beside her wheel and the carded wool like a snow drift NEWLINE piled at her knee her white hands feeding the ravenous spindle  NEWLINE while with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion  NEWLINE open wide on her lap lay the well worn psalm book of ainsworth  NEWLINE printed in amsterdam the words and the music together  NEWLINE rough hewn angular notes like stones in the wall of a churchyard NEWLINE   NEWLINE darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses  NEWLINE such was the book from whose pages she sang the old puritan anthem  NEWLINE she the puritan girl in the solitude of the forest  NEWLINE making the humble house and the modest apparel of home spun NEWLINE beautiful with her beauty and rich with the wealth of her being  NEWLINE over him rushed like a wind that is keen and cold and relentless  NEWLINE thoughts of what might have been and the weight and woe of his errand  NEWLINE all the dreams that had faded and all the hopes that had vanished  NEWLINE all his life henceforth a dreary and tenantless mansion  NEWLINE haunted by vain regrets and pallid sorrowful faces  NEWLINE still he said to himself and almost fiercely he said it  NEWLINE  let not him that putteth his hand to the plough look backwards  NEWLINE though the ploughshare cut through the flowers of life to its fountains  NEWLINE though it pass over the graves of the dead and the hearths of the living  NEWLINE it is the will of the lord and his mercy endureth for ever  NEWLINE so he entered the house and the hum of the wheel and the singing NEWLINE suddenly ceased for priscilla aroused by his step on the threshold  NEWLINE rose as he entered and gave him her hand in signal of welcome  NEWLINE saying i knew it was you when i heard your step in the passage  NEWLINE for i was thinking of you as i sat there singing and spinning  NEWLINE awkward and dumb with delight that a thought of him had been mingled NEWLINE thus in the sacred psalm that came from the heart of the maiden  NEWLINE silent before her he stood and gave her the flowers for an answer  NEWLINE finding no words for his thought he remembered that day in the winter  NEWLINE after the first great snow when he broke a path from the village  NEWLINE reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway  NEWLINE stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house and priscilla NEWLINE laughed at his snowy locks and gave him a seat by the fireside  NEWLINE grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snow storm  NEWLINE had he but spoken then perhaps not in vain had he spoken  NEWLINE now it was all too late the golden moment had vanished  NEWLINE so he stood there abashed and gave her the flowers for an answer  NEWLINE then they sat down and talked of the birds and the beautiful spring time  NEWLINE talked of their friends at home and the mayflower that sailed on the morrow  NEWLINE  i have been thinking all day said gently the puritan maiden  NEWLINE  dreaming all night and thinking all day of the hedge rows of england — NEWLINE they are in blossom now and the country is all like a garden  NEWLINE thinking of lanes and fields and the song of the lark and the linnet  NEWLINE seeing the village street and familiar faces of neighbors NEWLINE going about as of old and stopping to gossip together  NEWLINE and at the end of the street the village church with the ivy NEWLINE climbing the old gray tower and the quiet graves in the churchyard  NEWLINE kind are the people i live with and dear to me my religion  NEWLINE still my heart is so sad that i wish myself back in old england  NEWLINE you will say it is wrong but i cannot help it i almost NEWLINE wish myself back in old england i feel so lonely and wretched  NEWLINE thereupon answered the youth — indeed i do not condemn you  NEWLINE stouter hearts than a woman s have quailed in this terrible winter  NEWLINE yours is tender and trusting and needs a stronger to lean on  NEWLINE so i have come to you now with an offer and proffer of marriage NEWLINE made by a good man and true miles standish the captain of plymouth  NEWLINE thus he delivered his message the dexterous writer of letters — NEWLINE did not embellish the theme nor array it in beautiful phrases  NEWLINE but came straight to the point and blurted it out like a schoolboy  NEWLINE even the captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly  NEWLINE mute with amazement and sorrow priscilla the puritan maiden NEWLINE looked into alden s face her eyes dilated with wonder  NEWLINE feeling his words like a blow that stunned her and rendered her speechless  NEWLINE till at length she exclaimed interrupting the ominous silence  NEWLINE  if the great captain of plymouth is so very eager to wed me  NEWLINE why does he not come himself and take the trouble to woo me  NEWLINE if i am not worth the wooing i surely am not worth the winning  NEWLINE then john alden began explaining and smoothing the matter  NEWLINE making it worse as he went by saying the captain was busy — NEWLINE had no time for such things such things the words grating harshly NEWLINE fell on the ear of priscilla and swift as a flash she made answer  NEWLINE  has he no time for such things as you call it before he is married  NEWLINE would he be likely to find it or make it after the wedding  NEWLINE that is the way with you men you do not understand us you cannot  NEWLINE when you have made up your minds after thinking of this one and that one  NEWLINE choosing selecting rejecting comparing one with another  NEWLINE then you make known your desire with abrupt and sudden avowal  NEWLINE and are offended and hurt and indignant perhaps that a woman NEWLINE does not respond at once to a love that she never suspected  NEWLINE does not attain at a bound the height to which you have been climbing  NEWLINE this is not right nor just for surely a woman s affection NEWLINE is not a thing to be asked for and had for only the asking  NEWLINE when one is truly in love one not only says it but shows it  NEWLINE had he but waited awhile had he only showed that he loved me  NEWLINE even this captain of yours who knows at last might have won me  NEWLINE old and rough as he is but now it never can happen  NEWLINE still john alden went on unheeding the words of priscilla  NEWLINE urging the suit of his friend explaining persuading expanding  NEWLINE spoke of his courage and skill and of all his battles in flanders  NEWLINE how with the people of god he had chosen to suffer affliction  NEWLINE how in return for his zeal they had made him captain of plymouth  NEWLINE he was a gentleman born could trace his pedigree plainly NEWLINE back to hugh standish of duxbury hall in lancashire england  NEWLINE who was the son of ralph and the grandson of thurston de standish  NEWLINE heir unto vast estates of which he was basely defrauded  NEWLINE still bore the family arms and had for his crest a cock argent NEWLINE combed and wattled gules and all the rest of the blazon  NEWLINE he was a man of honor of noble and generous nature  NEWLINE though he was rough he was kindly she knew how during the winter NEWLINE he had attended the sick with a hand as gentle as woman s  NEWLINE somewhat hasty and hot he could not deny it and headstrong  NEWLINE stern as a soldier might be but hearty and placable always  NEWLINE not to be laughed at and scorned because he was little of stature  NEWLINE for he was great of heart magnanimous courtly courageous  NEWLINE any woman in plymouth nay any woman in england  NEWLINE might be happy and proud to be called the wife of miles standish  NEWLINE but as he warmed and glowed in his simple and eloquent language  NEWLINE quite forgetful of self and full of the praise of his rival  NEWLINE archly the maiden smiled and with eyes over running with laughter  NEWLINE said in a tremulous voice why do not you speak for yourself john  NEWLINE iv NEWLINE john alden NEWLINE into the open air john alden perplexed and bewildered  NEWLINE rushed like a man insane and wandered alone by the sea side  NEWLINE paced up and down the sands and bared his head to the east wind  NEWLINE cooling his heated brow and the fire and fever within him  NEWLINE slowly as out of the heavens with apocalyptical splendors  NEWLINE sank the city of god in the vision of john the apostle  NEWLINE so with its cloudy walls of chrysolite jasper and sapphire  NEWLINE sank the broad red sun and over its turrets uplifted NEWLINE glimmered the golden reed of the angel who measured the city  NEWLINE  welcome o wind of the east he exclaimed in his wild exultation  NEWLINE  welcome o wind of the east from the caves of the misty atlantic  NEWLINE blowing over fields of dulse and measureless meadows of sea grass  NEWLINE blowing over rocky wastes and the grottos and gardens of ocean  NEWLINE lay thy cold moist hand on my burning forehead and wrap me NEWLINE close in thy garments of mist to allay the fever within me  NEWLINE like an awakened conscience the sea was moaning and tossing  NEWLINE beating remorseful and loud the mutable sands of the sea shore  NEWLINE fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending  NEWLINE love triumphant and crowned and friendship wounded and bleeding  NEWLINE passionate cries of desire and importunate pleadings of duty  NEWLINE  is it my fault he said that the maiden has chosen between us  NEWLINE is it my fault that he failed my fault that i am the victor  NEWLINE then within him there thundered a voice like the voice of the prophet  NEWLINE  it hath displeased the lord and he thought of david s transgression  NEWLINE bathsheba s beautiful face and his friend in the front of the battle  NEWLINE shame and confusion of guilt and abasement and self condemnation  NEWLINE overwhelmed him at once and he cried in the deepest contrition  NEWLINE  it hath displeased the lord it is the temptation of satan  NEWLINE then uplifting his head he looked at the sea and beheld there NEWLINE dimly the shadowy form of the mayflower riding at anchor  NEWLINE rocked on the rising tide and ready to sail on the morrow  NEWLINE heard the voices of men through the mist the rattle of cordage NEWLINE thrown on the deck the shouts of the mate and the sailors ay ay sir  NEWLINE clear and distinct but not loud in the dripping air of the twilight  NEWLINE still for a moment he stood and listened and stared at the vessel  NEWLINE then went hurriedly on as one who seeing a phantom  NEWLINE stops then quickens his pace and follows the beckoning shadow  NEWLINE  yes it is plain to me now he murmured the hand of the lord is NEWLINE leading me out of the land of darkness the bondage of error  NEWLINE through the sea that shall lift the walls of its waters around me  NEWLINE hiding me cutting me off from the cruel thoughts that pursue me  NEWLINE back will i go over the ocean this dreary land will abandon  NEWLINE her whom i may not love and him whom my heart has offended  NEWLINE better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in england  NEWLINE close by my mother s side and among the dust of my kindred  NEWLINE better be dead and forgotten than living in shame and dishonor  NEWLINE sacred and safe and unseen in the dark of the narrow chamber NEWLINE with me my secret shall lie like a buried jewel that glimmers NEWLINE bright on the hand that is dust in the chambers of silence and darkness — NEWLINE yes as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter  NEWLINE thus as he spake he turned in the strength of his strong resolution  NEWLINE leaving behind him the shore and hurried along in the twilight  NEWLINE through the congenial gloom of the forest silent and sombre  NEWLINE till he beheld the lights in the seven houses of plymouth  NEWLINE shining like seven stars in the dusk and mist of the evening  NEWLINE soon he entered his door and found the redoubtable captain NEWLINE sitting alone and absorbed in the martial pages of caesar  NEWLINE fighting some great campaign in hainault or brabant or flanders  NEWLINE  long have you been on your errand he said with a cheery demeanor  NEWLINE even as one who is waiting an answer and fears not the issue  NEWLINE  not far off is the house although the woods are between us  NEWLINE but you have lingered so long that while you were going and coming NEWLINE i have fought ten battles and sacked and demolished a city  NEWLINE come sit down and in order relate to me all that has happened  NEWLINE then john alden spake and related the wondrous adventure  NEWLINE from beginning to end minutely just as it happened  NEWLINE how he had seen priscilla and how he had sped in his courtship  NEWLINE only smoothing a little and softening down her refusal  NEWLINE but when he came at length to the words priscilla had spoken  NEWLINE words so tender and cruel why do not you speak for yourself john  NEWLINE up leaped the captain of plymouth and stamped on the floor till his armor NEWLINE clanged on the wall where it hung with a sound of sinister omen  NEWLINE all his pent up wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion  NEWLINE even as a hand grenade that scatters destruction around it  NEWLINE wildly he shouted and loud john alden you have betrayed me  NEWLINE me miles standish your friend have supplanted defrauded betrayed me  NEWLINE one of my ancestors ran his sword through the heart of wat tyler  NEWLINE who shall prevent me from running my own through the heart of a traitor  NEWLINE yours is the greater treason for yours is a treason to friendship  NEWLINE you who lived under my roof whom i cherished and loved as a brother  NEWLINE you who have fed at my board and drunk at my cup to whose keeping NEWLINE i have intrusted my honor my thoughts the most sacred and secret — NEWLINE you too brutus ah woe to the name of friendship hereafter  NEWLINE brutus was caesar s friend and you were mine but henceforward NEWLINE let there be nothing between us save war and implacable hatred  NEWLINE so spake the captain of plymouth and strode about in the chamber  NEWLINE chafing and choking with rage like cords were the veins on his temples  NEWLINE but in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway  NEWLINE bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance  NEWLINE rumors of danger and war and hostile incursions of indians  NEWLINE straightway the captain paused and without further question or parley  NEWLINE took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron  NEWLINE buckled the belt round his waist and frowning fiercely departed  NEWLINE alden was left alone he heard the clank of the scabbard NEWLINE growing fainter and fainter and dying away in the distance  NEWLINE then he arose from his seat and looked forth into the darkness  NEWLINE felt the cool air blow on his cheek that was hot with the insult  NEWLINE lifted his eyes to the heavens and folding his hands as in childhood  NEWLINE prayed in the silence of night to the father who seeth in secret  NEWLINE meanwhile the choleric captain strode wrathful away to the council  NEWLINE found it already assembled impatiently waiting his coming  NEWLINE men in the middle of life austere and grave in deportment  NEWLINE only one of them old the hill that was nearest to heaven  NEWLINE covered with snow but erect the excellent elder of plymouth  NEWLINE god had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting  NEWLINE then had sifted the wheat as the living seed of a nation  NEWLINE so say the chronicles old and such is the faith of the people  NEWLINE near them was standing an indian in attitude stern and defiant  NEWLINE naked down to the waist and grim and ferocious in aspect  NEWLINE while on the table before them was lying unopened a bible  NEWLINE ponderous bound in leather brass studded printed in holland  NEWLINE and beside it outstretched the skin of a rattle snake glittered  NEWLINE filled like a quiver with arrows a signal and challenge of warfare  NEWLINE brought by the indian and speaking with arrowy tongues of defiance  NEWLINE this miles standish beheld as he entered and heard them debating NEWLINE what were an answer befitting the hostile message and menace  NEWLINE talking of this and of that contriving suggesting objecting  NEWLINE one voice only for peace and that the voice of the elder  NEWLINE judging it wise and well that some at least were converted  NEWLINE rather than any were slain for this was but christian behavior  NEWLINE then out spake miles standish the stalwart captain of plymouth  NEWLINE muttering deep in his throat for his voice was husky with anger  NEWLINE  what do you mean to make war with milk and the water of roses  NEWLINE is it to shoot red squirrels you have your howitzer planted NEWLINE there on the roof of the church or is it to shoot red devils  NEWLINE truly the only tongue that is understood by a savage NEWLINE must be the tongue of fire that speaks from the mouth of the cannon  NEWLINE thereupon answered and said the excellent elder of plymouth  NEWLINE somewhat amazed and alarmed at this irreverent language  NEWLINE  not so thought saint paul nor yet the other apostles  NEWLINE not from the cannon s mouth were the tongues of fire they spake with  NEWLINE but unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the captain  NEWLINE who had advanced to the table and thus continued discoursing  NEWLINE  leave this matter to me for to me by right it pertaineth  NEWLINE war is a terrible trade but in the because that is righteous  NEWLINE sweet is the smell of powder and thus i answer the challenge  NEWLINE then from the rattlesnake s skin with a sudden contemptuous gesture  NEWLINE jerking the indian arrows he filled it with powder and bullets NEWLINE full to the very jaws and handed it back to the savage  NEWLINE saying in thundering tones here take it this is your answer  NEWLINE silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage  NEWLINE bearing the serpent s skin and seeming himself like a serpent  NEWLINE winding his sinuous way in the dark to the depths of the forest  NEWLINE v NEWLINE the sailing of the may flower NEWLINE just in the gray of the dawn as the mists uprose from the meadows  NEWLINE there was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of plymouth  NEWLINE clanging and clicking of arms and the order imperative forward  NEWLINE given in tone suppressed a tramp of feet and then silence  NEWLINE figures ten in the mist marched slowly out of the village  NEWLINE standish the stalwart it was with eight of his valorous army  NEWLINE led by their indian guide by hobomok friend of the white men  NEWLINE northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage  NEWLINE giants they seemed in the mist or the mighty men of king david  NEWLINE giants in heart they were who believed in god and the bible — NEWLINE ay who believed in the smiting of midianites and philistines  NEWLINE over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning  NEWLINE under them loud on the sands the serried billows advancing  NEWLINE fired along the line and in regular order retreated  NEWLINE many a mile had they marched when at length the village of plymouth NEWLINE woke from its sleep and arose intent on its manifold labors  NEWLINE sweet was the air and soft and slowly the smoke from the chimneys NEWLINE rose over roofs of thatch and pointed steadily eastward  NEWLINE men came forth from the doors and paused and talked of the weather  NEWLINE said that the wind had changed and was blowing fair for the mayflower  NEWLINE talked of their captain s departure and all the dangers that menaced  NEWLINE he being gone the town and what should be done in his absence  NEWLINE merrily sang the birds and the tender voices of women NEWLINE consecrated with hymns the common cares of the household  NEWLINE out of the sea rose the sun and the billows rejoiced at his coming  NEWLINE beautiful were his feet on the purple tops of the mountains  NEWLINE beautiful on the sails of the mayflower riding at anchor  NEWLINE battered and blackened and worn by all the storms of the winter  NEWLINE loosely against her masts was hanging and flapping her canvas  NEWLINE rent by so many gales and patched by the hands of the sailors  NEWLINE suddenly from her side as the sun rose over the ocean  NEWLINE darted a puff of smoke and floated seaward anon rang NEWLINE loud over field and forest the cannon s roar and the echoes NEWLINE heard and repeated the sound the signal gun of departure  NEWLINE ah but with louder echoes replied the hearts of the people  NEWLINE meekly in voices subdued the chapter was read from the bible  NEWLINE meekly the prayer was begun but ended in fervent entreaty  NEWLINE then from their houses in haste came forth the pilgrims of plymouth  NEWLINE men and women and children all hurrying down to the sea shore  NEWLINE eager with tearful eyes to say farewell to the mayflower  NEWLINE homeward bound over the sea and leaving them here in the desert  NEWLINE foremost among them was alden all night he had lain without slumber  NEWLINE turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever  NEWLINE he had beheld miles standish who came back late from the council  NEWLINE stalking into the room and heard him mutter and murmur  NEWLINE sometimes it seemed a prayer and sometimes it sounded like swearing  NEWLINE once he had come to the bed and stood there a moment in silence  NEWLINE then he had turned away and said i will not awake him  NEWLINE let him sleep on it is best for what is the use of more talking  NEWLINE then he extinguished the light and threw himself down on his pallet  NEWLINE dressed as he was and ready to start at the break of the morning — NEWLINE covered himself with the cloak he had worn in his campaigns in flanders — NEWLINE slept as a soldier sleeps in his bivouac ready for action  NEWLINE but with the dawn he arose in the twilight alden beheld him NEWLINE put on his corselet of steel and all the rest of his armor  NEWLINE buckle about his waist his trusty blade of damascus  NEWLINE take from the corner his musket and so stride out of the chamber  NEWLINE often the heart of the youth had burned and yearned to embrace him  NEWLINE often his lips had essayed to speak imploring for pardon  NEWLINE all the old friendship came back with its tender and grateful emotions  NEWLINE but his pride overmastered the nobler nature within him — NEWLINE pride and the sense of his wrong and the burning fire of the insult  NEWLINE so he beheld his friend departing in anger but spake not  NEWLINE saw him go forth to danger perhaps to death and he spake not  NEWLINE then he arose from his bed and heard what the people were saying  NEWLINE joined in the talk at the door with stephen and richard and gilbert  NEWLINE joined in the morning prayer and in the reading of scripture  NEWLINE and with the others in haste went hurrying down to the sea shore  NEWLINE down to the plymouth rock that had been to their feet as a door step NEWLINE into a world unknown the corner stone of a nation  NEWLINE there with his boat was the master already a little impatient NEWLINE lest he should lose the tide or the wind might shift to the eastward  NEWLINE square built hearty and strong with an odor of ocean about him  NEWLINE speaking with this one and that and cramming letters and parcels NEWLINE into his pockets capacious and messages mingled together NEWLINE into his narrow brain till at last he was wholly bewildered  NEWLINE nearer the boat stood alden with one foot placed on the gunwale  NEWLINE one still firm on the rock and talking at times with the sailors  NEWLINE seated erect on the thwarts all ready and eager for starting  NEWLINE he too was eager to go and thus put an end to his anguish  NEWLINE thinking to fly from despair that swifter than keel is or canvas  NEWLINE thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him  NEWLINE but as he gazed on the crowd he beheld the form of priscilla NEWLINE standing dejected among them unconscious of all that was passing  NEWLINE fixed were her eyes upon his as if she divined his intention  NEWLINE fixed with a look so sad so reproachful imploring and patient  NEWLINE that with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose  NEWLINE as from the verge of a crag where one step more is destruction  NEWLINE strange is the heart of man with its quick mysterious instincts  NEWLINE strange is the life of man and fatal or fated are moments  NEWLINE whereupon turn as on hinges the gates of the wall adamantine  NEWLINE  here i remain he exclaimed as he looked at the heavens above him  NEWLINE thanking the lord whose breath had scattered the mist and the madness  NEWLINE wherein blind and lost to death he was staggering headlong  NEWLINE  yonder snow white cloud that floats in the ether above me  NEWLINE seems like a hand that is pointing and beckoning over the ocean  NEWLINE there is another hand that is not so spectral and ghost like  NEWLINE holding me drawing me back and clasping mine for protection  NEWLINE float o hand of cloud and vanish away in the ether  NEWLINE roll thyself up like a fist to threaten and daunt me i heed not NEWLINE either your warning or menace or any omen of evil  NEWLINE there is no land so sacred no air so pure and so wholesome  NEWLINE as is the air she breathes and the soil that is pressed by her footsteps  NEWLINE here for her sake will i stay and like an invisible presence NEWLINE hover around her for ever protecting supporting her weakness  NEWLINE yes as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the landing  NEWLINE so with the blessing of god shall it be the last at the leaving  NEWLINE meanwhile the master alert but with dignified air and important  NEWLINE scanning with watchful eye the tide and the wind and the weather  NEWLINE walked about on the sands and the people crowded around him NEWLINE saying a few last words and enforcing his careful remembrance  NEWLINE then taking each by the hand as if he were grasping a tiller  NEWLINE into the boat he sprang and in haste shoved off to his vessel  NEWLINE glad in his heart to get rid of all this worry and flurry  NEWLINE glad to be gone from a land of sand and sickness and sorrow  NEWLINE short allowance of victual and plenty of nothing but gospel  NEWLINE lost in the sound of the oars was the last farewell of the pilgrims  NEWLINE o strong hearts and true not one went back in the mayflower  NEWLINE no not one looked back who had set his hand to this ploughing  NEWLINE soon were heard on board the shouts and songs of the sailors NEWLINE heaving the windlass round and hoisting the ponderous anchor  NEWLINE then the yards were braced and all sails set to the west wind  NEWLINE blowing steady and strong and the mayflower sailed from the harbor  NEWLINE rounded the point of the gurnet and leaving far to the southward NEWLINE island and cape of sand and the field of the first encounter  NEWLINE took the wind on her quarter and stood for the open atlantic  NEWLINE borne on the send of the sea and the swelling hearts of the pilgrims  NEWLINE long in silence they watched the receding sail of the vessel  NEWLINE much endeared to them all as something living and human  NEWLINE then as if filled with the spirit and wrapt in a vision prophetic  NEWLINE baring his hoary head the excellent elder of plymouth NEWLINE said let us pray and they prayed and thanked the lord and took courage  NEWLINE mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock and above them NEWLINE bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death and their kindred NEWLINE seemed to awake in their graves and to join in the prayer that they uttered  NEWLINE sun illumined and white on the eastern verge of the ocean NEWLINE gleamed the departing sail like a marble slab in a graveyard  NEWLINE buried beneath it lay for ever all hope of escaping  NEWLINE lo as they turned to depart they saw the form of an indian  NEWLINE watching them from the hill but while they spake with each other  NEWLINE pointing with outstretched hands and saying look he had vanished  NEWLINE so they returned to their homes but alden lingered a little  NEWLINE musing alone on the shore and watching the wash of the billows NEWLINE round the base of the rock and the sparkle and flash of the sunshine  NEWLINE like the spirit of god moving visibly over the waters  NEWLINE vi NEWLINE priscilla NEWLINE thus for a while he stood and mused by the shore of the ocean  NEWLINE thinking of many things and most of all of priscilla  NEWLINE and as if thought had the power to draw to itself like the loadstone  NEWLINE whatsoever it touches by subtile laws of its nature  NEWLINE lo as he turned to depart priscilla was standing beside him  NEWLINE  are you so much offended you will not speak to me said she  NEWLINE  am i so much to blame that yesterday when you were pleading NEWLINE warmly the because of another my heart impulsive and wayward  NEWLINE pleaded your own and spake out forgetful perhaps of decorum  NEWLINE certainly you can forgive me for speaking so frankly for saying NEWLINE what i ought not to have said yet now i can never unsay it  NEWLINE for there are moments in life when the heart is so full of emotion  NEWLINE that if by chance it be shaken or into its depths like a pebble NEWLINE drops some careless word it overflows and its secret  NEWLINE spilt on the ground like water can never be gathered together  NEWLINE yesterday i was shocked when i heard you speak of miles standish  NEWLINE praising his virtues transforming his very defects into virtues  NEWLINE praising his courage and strength and even his fighting in flanders  NEWLINE as if by fighting alone you could win the heart of a woman  NEWLINE quite overlooking yourself and the rest in exalting your hero  NEWLINE therefore i spake as i did by an irresistible impulse  NEWLINE you will forgive me i hope for the sake of the friendship between us  NEWLINE which is too true and too sacred to be so easily broken  NEWLINE thereupon answered john alden the scholar the friend of miles standish  NEWLINE  i was not angry with you with myself alone i was angry  NEWLINE seeing how badly i managed the matter i had in my keeping  NEWLINE  no interrupted the maiden with answer prompt and decisive  NEWLINE  no you were angry with me for speaking so frankly and freely  NEWLINE it was wrong i acknowledge for it is the fate of a woman NEWLINE long to be patient and silent to wait like a ghost that is speechless  NEWLINE till some questioning voice dissolves the spell of its silence  NEWLINE hence is the inner life of so many suffering women NEWLINE sunless and silent and deep like subterranean rivers NEWLINE running through caverns of darkness unheard unseen and unfruitful  NEWLINE chafing their channels of stone with endless and profitless murmurs  NEWLINE thereupon answered john alden the young man the lover of women  NEWLINE  heaven forbid it priscilla and truly they seem to me always NEWLINE more like the beautiful rivers that watered the garden of eden  NEWLINE more like the river euphrates through deserts of havilah flowing  NEWLINE filling the land with delight and memories sweet of the garden  NEWLINE  ah by these words i can see again interrupted the maiden  NEWLINE  how very little you prize me or care for what i am saying  NEWLINE when from the depths of my heart in pain and with secret misgiving  NEWLINE frankly i speak to you asking for sympathy only and kindness  NEWLINE straightway you take up my words that are plain and direct and in earnest  NEWLINE turn them away from their meaning and answer with flattering phrases  NEWLINE this is not right is not just is not true to the best that is in you  NEWLINE for i know and esteem you and feel that your nature is noble  NEWLINE lifting mine up to a higher a more ethereal level  NEWLINE therefore i value your friendship and feel it perhaps the more keenly NEWLINE if you say aught that implies i am only as one among many  NEWLINE if you make use of those common and complimentary phrases NEWLINE most men think so fine in dealing and speaking with women  NEWLINE but which women reject as insipid if not as insulting  NEWLINE mute and amazed was alden and listened and looked at priscilla  NEWLINE thinking he never had seen her more fair more divine in her beauty  NEWLINE he who but yesterday pleaded so glibly the because of another  NEWLINE stood there embarrassed and silent and seeking in vain for an answer  NEWLINE so the maiden went on and little divined or imagined NEWLINE what was at work in his heart that made him so awkward and speechless  NEWLINE  let us then be what we are and speak what we think and in all things NEWLINE keep ourselves loyal to truth and the sacred professions of friendship  NEWLINE it is no secret i tell you nor am i ashamed to declare it  NEWLINE i have liked to be with you to see you to speak with you always  NEWLINE so i was hurt at your words and a little affronted to hear you NEWLINE urge me to marry your friend though he were the captain miles standish  NEWLINE for i must tell you the truth much more to me is your friendship NEWLINE than all the love he could give were he twice the hero you think him  NEWLINE then she extended her hand and alden who eagerly grasped it  NEWLINE felt all the wounds in his heart that were aching and bleeding so sorely  NEWLINE healed by the touch of that hand and he said with a voice full of feeling  NEWLINE  yes we must ever be friends and of all who offer you friendship NEWLINE let me be ever the first the truest the nearest and dearest  NEWLINE casting a farewell look at the glimmering sail of the mayflower  NEWLINE distant but still in sight and sinking below the horizon  NEWLINE homeward together they walked with a strange indefinite feeling  NEWLINE that all the rest had departed and left them alone in the desert  NEWLINE but as they went through the fields in the blessing and smile of the sunshine  NEWLINE lighter grew their hearts and priscilla said very archly  NEWLINE  now that our terrible captain has gone in pursuit of the indians  NEWLINE where he is happier far than he would be commanding a household  NEWLINE you may speak boldly and tell me of all that happened between you  NEWLINE when you returned last night and said how ungrateful you found me  NEWLINE thereupon answered john alden and told her the whole of the story — NEWLINE told her his own despair and the direful wrath of miles standish  NEWLINE whereat the maiden smiled and said between laughing and earnest  NEWLINE  he is a little chimney and heated hot in a moment  NEWLINE but as he gently rebuked her and told her how much he had suffered — NEWLINE how he had even determined to sail that day in the mayflower  NEWLINE and had remained for her sake on hearing the dangers that threatened — NEWLINE all her manner was changed and she said with a faltering accent  NEWLINE  truly i thank you for this how good you have been to me always  NEWLINE thus as a pilgrim devout who toward jerusalem journeys  NEWLINE taking three steps in advance and one reluctantly backward  NEWLINE urged by importunate zeal and withheld by pangs of contrition  NEWLINE slowly but steadily onward receding yet ever advancing  NEWLINE journeyed this puritan youth to the holy land of his longings  NEWLINE urged by the fervor of love and withheld by remorseful misgivings  NEWLINE vii NEWLINE the march of miles standish NEWLINE meanwhile the stalwart miles standish was marching steadily northward  NEWLINE winding through forest and swamp and along the trend of the sea shore  NEWLINE all day long with hardly a halt the fire of his anger NEWLINE burning and crackling within and the sulphurous odor of powder NEWLINE seeming more sweet to his nostrils than all the scents of the forest  NEWLINE silent and moody he went and much he revolved his discomfort  NEWLINE he who was used to success and to easy victories always  NEWLINE thus to be flouted rejected and laughed to scorn by a maiden  NEWLINE thus to be mocked and betrayed by the friend whom most he had trusted  NEWLINE ah t was too much to be borne and he fretted and chafed in his armor  NEWLINE  i alone am to blame he muttered for mine was the folly  NEWLINE what has a rough old soldier grown grim and gray in the harness  NEWLINE used to the camp and its ways to do with the wooing of maidens  NEWLINE  t was but a dream let it pass let it vanish like so many others  NEWLINE what i thought was a flower is only a weed and is worthless  NEWLINE out of my heart will i pluck it and throw it away and henceforward NEWLINE be but a fighter of battles a lover and wooer of dangers  NEWLINE thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort  NEWLINE while he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest  NEWLINE looking up at the trees and the constellations beyond them  NEWLINE after a three days march he came to an indian encampment NEWLINE pitched on the edge of a meadow between the sea and the forest  NEWLINE women at work by the tents and the warriors horrid with war paint  NEWLINE seated about a fire and smoking and talking together  NEWLINE who when they saw from afar the sudden approach of the white men  NEWLINE saw the flash of the sun on breastplate and sabre and musket  NEWLINE straightway leaped to their feet and two from among them advancing  NEWLINE came to parley with standish and offer him furs as a present  NEWLINE friendship was in their looks but in their hearts there was hatred  NEWLINE braves of the tribe were these and brothers gigantic in stature  NEWLINE huge as goliath of gath or the terrible og king of bashan  NEWLINE one was pecksuot named and the other was called wattawamat  NEWLINE round their necks were suspended their knives in scabbards of wampum  NEWLINE two edged trenchant knives with points as sharp as a needle  NEWLINE other arms had they none for they were cunning and crafty  NEWLINE  welcome english they said these words they had learned from the traders NEWLINE touching at times on the coast to barter and chaffer for peltries  NEWLINE then in their native tongue they began to parley with standish  NEWLINE through his guide and interpreter hobomok friend of the white man  NEWLINE begging for blankets and knives but mostly for muskets and powder  NEWLINE kept by the white man they said concealed with the plague in his cellars  NEWLINE ready to be let loose and destroy his brother the red man  NEWLINE but when standish refused and said he would give them the bible  NEWLINE suddenly changing their tone they began to boast and to bluster  NEWLINE then wattawamat advanced with a stride in front of the other  NEWLINE and with a lofty demeanor thus vauntingly spake to the captain  NEWLINE  now wattawamat can see by the fiery eyes of the captain  NEWLINE angry is he in his heart but the heart of the brave wattawamat NEWLINE is not afraid at the sight he was not born of a woman  NEWLINE but on a mountain at night from an oak tree riven by lightning  NEWLINE forth he sprang at a bound with all his weapons about him  NEWLINE shouting who is there here to fight with the brave wattawamat  NEWLINE then he unsheathed his knife and whetting the blade on his left hand  NEWLINE held it aloft and displayed a woman s face on the handle  NEWLINE saying with bitter expression and look of sinister meaning  NEWLINE  i have another at home with the face of a man on the handle  NEWLINE by and by they shall marry and there will be plenty of children  NEWLINE then stood pecksuot forth self vaunting insulting miles standish  NEWLINE while with his fingers he petted the knife that hung at his bosom  NEWLINE drawing it half from its sheath and plunging it back as he muttered  NEWLINE  by and by it shall see it shall eat ah ha but shall speak not  NEWLINE this is the mighty captain the white men have sent to destroy us  NEWLINE he is a little man let him go and work with the women  NEWLINE meanwhile standish had noted the faces and figures of indians NEWLINE peeping and creeping about from bush to tree in the forest  NEWLINE feigning to look for game with arrows set on their bow strings  NEWLINE drawing about him still closer and closer the net of their ambush  NEWLINE but undaunted he stood and dissembled and treated them smoothly  NEWLINE so the old chronicles say that were writ in the days of the fathers  NEWLINE but when he heard their defiance the boast the taunt and the insult  NEWLINE all the hot blood of his race of sir hugh and of thurston de standish  NEWLINE boiled and beat in his heart and swelled in the veins of his temples  NEWLINE headlong he leaped on the boaster and snatching his knife from its scabbard  NEWLINE plunged it into his heart and reeling backward the savage NEWLINE fell with his face to the sky and a fiendlike fierceness upon it  NEWLINE straight there arose from the forest the awful sound of the war whoop  NEWLINE and like a flurry of snow on the whistling wind of december  NEWLINE swift and sudden and keen came a flight of feathery arrows  NEWLINE then came a cloud of smoke and out of the cloud came the lightning  NEWLINE out of the lightning thunder and death unseen ran before it  NEWLINE frightened the savages fled for shelter in swamp and in thicket  NEWLINE hotly pursued and beset but their sachem the brave wattawamat  NEWLINE fled not he was dead unswerving and swift had a bullet NEWLINE passed through his brain and he fell with both hands clutching the greensward  NEWLINE seeming in death to hold back from his foe the land of his fathers  NEWLINE there on the flowers of the meadow the warriors lay and above them  NEWLINE silent with folded arms stood hobomok friend of the white man  NEWLINE smiling at length he exclaimed to the stalwart captain of plymouth  NEWLINE  pecksuot bragged very loud of his courage his strength and his stature — NEWLINE mocked the great captain and called him a little man but i see now NEWLINE big enough have you been to lay him speechless before you  NEWLINE thus the first battle was fought and won by the stalwart miles standish  NEWLINE when the tidings thereof were brought to the village of plymouth  NEWLINE and as a trophy of war the head of the brave wattawamat NEWLINE scowled from the roof of the fort which at once was a church and a fortress  NEWLINE all who beheld it rejoiced and praised the lord and took courage  NEWLINE only priscilla averted her face from this spectre of terror  NEWLINE thanking god in her heart that she had not married miles standish  NEWLINE shrinking fearing almost lest coming home from his battles  NEWLINE he should lay claim to her hand as the prize and reward of his valor  NEWLINE viii NEWLINE the spinning wheel NEWLINE month after month passed away and in autumn the ships of the merchants NEWLINE came with kindred and friends with cattle and corn for the pilgrims  NEWLINE all in the village was peace the men were intent on their labors  NEWLINE busy with hewing and building with garden plot and with merestead  NEWLINE busy with breaking the glebe and mowing the grass in the meadows  NEWLINE searching the sea for its fish and hunting the deer in the forest  NEWLINE all in the village was peace but at times the rumor of warfare NEWLINE filled the air with alarm and the apprehension of danger  NEWLINE bravely the stalwart miles standish was scouring the land with his forces  NEWLINE waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies  NEWLINE till his name had become a sound of fear to the nations  NEWLINE anger was still in his heart but at times the remorse and contrition NEWLINE which in all noble natures succeed the passionate outbreak  NEWLINE came like a rising tide that encounters the rush of a river  NEWLINE staying its current awhile but making it bitter and brackish  NEWLINE meanwhile alden at home had built him a new habitation  NEWLINE solid substantial of timber rough hewn from the firs of the forest  NEWLINE wooden barred was the door and the roof was covered with rushes  NEWLINE latticed the windows were and the window panes were of paper  NEWLINE oiled to admit the light while wind and rain were excluded  NEWLINE there too he dug a well and around it planted an orchard  NEWLINE still may be seen to this day some trace of the well and the orchard  NEWLINE close to the house was the stall where safe and secure from annoyance  NEWLINE raghorn the snow white steer that had fallen to alden s allotment NEWLINE in the division of cattle might ruminate in the night time NEWLINE over the pastures he cropped made fragrant by sweet pennyroyal  NEWLINE oft when his labor was finished with eager feet would the dreamer NEWLINE follow the pathway that ran through the woods to the house of priscilla  NEWLINE led by illusions romantic and subtile deceptions of fancy  NEWLINE pleasure disguised as duty and love in the semblance of friendship  NEWLINE ever of her he thought when he fashioned the walls of his dwelling  NEWLINE ever of her he thought when he delved in the soil of his garden  NEWLINE ever of her he thought when he read in his bible on sunday NEWLINE praise of the virtuous woman as she is described in the proverbs — NEWLINE how the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her always  NEWLINE how all the days of her life she will do him good and not evil  NEWLINE how she seeketh the wool and the flax and worketh with gladness  NEWLINE how she layeth her hand to the spindle and holdeth the distaff  NEWLINE how she is not afraid of the snow for herself or her household  NEWLINE knowing her household are clothed with the scarlet cloth of her weaving  NEWLINE so as she sat at her wheel one afternoon in the autumn  NEWLINE alden who opposite sat and was watching her dexterous fingers  NEWLINE as if the thread she was spinning were that of his life and his fortune  NEWLINE after a pause in their talk thus spake to the sound of the spindle  NEWLINE  truly priscilla he said when i see you spinning and spinning  NEWLINE never idle a moment but thrifty and thoughtful of others  NEWLINE suddenly you are transformed are visibly changed in a moment  NEWLINE you are no longer priscilla but bertha the beautiful spinner  NEWLINE here the light foot on the treadle grew swifter and swifter the spindle NEWLINE uttered an angry snarl and the thread snapped short in her fingers  NEWLINE while the impetuous speaker not heeding the mischief continued  NEWLINE  you are the beautiful bertha the spinner the queen of helvetia  NEWLINE she whose story i read at a stall in the streets of southampton  NEWLINE who as she rode on her palfrey over valley and meadow and mountain  NEWLINE ever was spinning her thread from a distaff fixed to her saddle  NEWLINE she was so thrifty and good that her name passed into a proverb  NEWLINE so shall it be with your own when the spinning wheel shall no longer NEWLINE hum in the house of the farmer and fill its chambers with music  NEWLINE then shall the mothers reproving relate how it was in their childhood  NEWLINE praising the good old times and the days of priscilla the spinner  NEWLINE straight uprose from her wheel the beautiful puritan maiden  NEWLINE pleased with the praise of her thrift from him whose praise was the sweetest  NEWLINE drew from the reel on the table a snowy skein of her spinning  NEWLINE thus making answer meanwhile to the flattering phrases of alden  NEWLINE  come you must not be idle if i am a pattern for housewives  NEWLINE show yourself equally worthy of being the model of husbands  NEWLINE hold this skein on your hands while i wind it ready for knitting  NEWLINE then who knows but hereafter when fashions have changed and the manners  NEWLINE fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of john alden  NEWLINE thus with a jest and a laugh the skein on his hands she adjusted  NEWLINE he sitting awkwardly there with his arms extended before him  NEWLINE she standing graceful erect and winding the thread from his fingers  NEWLINE sometimes chiding a little his clumsy manner of holding  NEWLINE sometimes touching his hands as she disentangled expertly NEWLINE twist or knot in the yarn unawares for how could she help it — NEWLINE sending electrical thrills through every nerve in his body  NEWLINE lo in the midst of this scene a breathless messenger entered  NEWLINE bringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village  NEWLINE yes miles standish was dead an indian had brought them the tidings — NEWLINE slain by a poisoned arrow shot down in the front of the battle  NEWLINE into an ambush beguiled cut off with the whole of his forces  NEWLINE all the town would be burned and all the people be murdered  NEWLINE such were the tidings of evil that burst on the hearts of the hearers  NEWLINE silent and statue like stood priscilla her face looking backward NEWLINE still at the face of the speaker her arms uplifted in horror  NEWLINE but john alden upstarting as if the barb of the arrow NEWLINE piercing the heart of his friend had struck his own and had sundered NEWLINE once and for ever the bonds that held him bound as a captive  NEWLINE wild with excess of sensation the awful delight of his freedom  NEWLINE mingled with pain and regret unconscious of what he was doing  NEWLINE clasped almost with a groan the motionless form of priscilla  NEWLINE pressing her close to his heart as for ever his own and exclaiming  NEWLINE  those whom the lord hath united let no man put them asunder  NEWLINE even as rivulets twain from distant and separate sources  NEWLINE seeing each other afar as they leap from the rocks and pursuing NEWLINE each one its devious path but drawing nearer and nearer  NEWLINE rush together at last at their trysting place in the forest  NEWLINE so these lives that had run thus far in separate channels  NEWLINE coming in sight of each other then swerving and flowing asunder  NEWLINE parted by barriers strong but drawing nearer and nearer  NEWLINE rushed together at last and one was lost in the other  NEWLINE ix NEWLINE the wedding day NEWLINE forth from the curtain of clouds from the tent of purple and scarlet  NEWLINE issued the sun the great high priest in his garments resplendent  NEWLINE holiness unto the lord in letters of light on his forehead  NEWLINE round the hem of his robe the golden bells and pomegranates  NEWLINE blessing the world he came and the bars of vapor beneath him NEWLINE gleamed like a grate of brass and the sea at his feet was a laver  NEWLINE this was the wedding morn of priscilla the puritan maiden  NEWLINE friends were assembled together the elder and magistrate also NEWLINE graced the scene with their presence and stood like the law and the gospel  NEWLINE one with the sanction of earth and one with the blessing of heaven  NEWLINE simple and brief was the wedding as that of ruth and of boaz  NEWLINE softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal  NEWLINE taking each other for husband and wife in the magistrate s presence  NEWLINE after the puritan way and the laudable custom of holland  NEWLINE fervently then and devoutly the excellent elder of plymouth NEWLINE prayed for the hearth and the home that were founded that day in affection  NEWLINE speaking of life and of death and imploring divine benedictions  NEWLINE lo when the service was ended a form appeared on the threshold  NEWLINE clad in armor of steel a sombre and sorrowful figure  NEWLINE why does the bridegroom start and stare at the strange apparition  NEWLINE why does the bride turn pale and hide her face on his shoulder  NEWLINE is it a phantom of air a bodiless spectral illusion  NEWLINE is it a ghost from the grave that has come to forbid the betrothal  NEWLINE long had it stood there unseen a guest uninvited unwelcomed  NEWLINE over its clouded eyes there had passed at times an expression NEWLINE softening the gloom and revealing the warm heart hidden beneath them  NEWLINE as when across the sky the driving rack of the rain cloud NEWLINE grows for a moment thin and betrays the sun by its brightness  NEWLINE once it had lifted its hand and moved its lips but was silent  NEWLINE as if an iron will had mastered the fleeting intention  NEWLINE but when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction  NEWLINE into the room it strode and the people beheld with amazement NEWLINE bodily there in his armor miles standish the captain of plymouth  NEWLINE grasping the bridegroom s hand he said with emotion forgive me  NEWLINE i have been angry and hurt too long have i cherished the feeling  NEWLINE i have been cruel and hard but now thank god it is ended  NEWLINE mine is the same hot blood that leaped in the veins of hugh standish  NEWLINE sensitive swift to resent but as swift in atoning for error  NEWLINE never so much as now was miles standish the friend of john alden  NEWLINE thereupon answered the bridegroom let all be forgotten between us — NEWLINE all save the dear old friendship and that shall grow older and dearer  NEWLINE then the captain advanced and bowing saluted priscilla  NEWLINE gravely and after the manner of old fashioned gentry in england  NEWLINE something of camp and of court of town and of country commingled  NEWLINE wishing her joy of her wedding and loudly lauding her husband  NEWLINE then he said with a smile i should have remembered the adage — NEWLINE if you would be well served you must serve yourself and moreover  NEWLINE no man can gather cherries in kent at the season of christmas  NEWLINE great was the people s amazement and greater yet their rejoicing  NEWLINE thus to behold once more the sun burnt face of their captain  NEWLINE whom they had mourned as dead and they gathered and crowded about him  NEWLINE eager to see him and hear him forgetful of bride and of bridegroom  NEWLINE questioning answering laughing and each interrupting the other  NEWLINE till the good captain declared being quite overpowered and bewildered  NEWLINE he had rather by far break into an indian encampment  NEWLINE than come again to a wedding to which he had not been invited  NEWLINE meanwhile the bridegroom went forth and stood with the bride at the doorway  NEWLINE breathing the perfumed air of that warm and beautiful morning  NEWLINE touched with autumnal tints but lonely and sad in the sunshine  NEWLINE lay extended before them the land of toil and privation  NEWLINE there were the graves of the dead and the barren waste of the sea shore  NEWLINE there the familiar fields the groves of pine and the meadows  NEWLINE but to their eyes transfigured it seemed as the garden of eden  NEWLINE filled with the presence of god whose voice was the sound of the ocean  NEWLINE soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure  NEWLINE friends coming forth from the house and impatient of longer delaying  NEWLINE each with his plan for the day and the work that was left uncompleted  NEWLINE then from a stall near at hand amid exclamations of wonder  NEWLINE alden the thoughtful the careful so happy so proud of priscilla  NEWLINE brought out his snow white steer obeying the hand of its master  NEWLINE led by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils  NEWLINE covered with crimson cloth and a cushion placed for a saddle  NEWLINE she should not walk he said through the dust and heat of the noonday  NEWLINE nay she should ride like a queen not plod along like a peasant  NEWLINE somewhat alarmed at first but reassured by the others  NEWLINE placing her hand on the cushion her foot in the hand of her husband  NEWLINE gayly with joyous laugh priscilla mounted her palfrey  NEWLINE  nothing is wanting now he said with a smile but the distaff  NEWLINE then you would be in truth my queen my beautiful bertha  NEWLINE onward the bridal procession now moved to their new habitation  NEWLINE happy husband and wife and friends conversing together  NEWLINE pleasantly murmured the brook as they crossed the ford in the forest  NEWLINE pleased with the image that passed like a dream of love through its bosom  NEWLINE tremulous floating in air over the depths of the azure abysses  NEWLINE down through the golden leaves the sun was pouring his splendors  NEWLINE gleaming on purple grapes that from branches above them suspended  NEWLINE mingled their odorous breath with the balm of the pine and the fir tree  NEWLINE wild and sweet as the clusters that grew in the valley of eshcol  NEWLINE like a picture it seemed of the primitive pastoral ages  NEWLINE fresh with the youth of the world and recalling rebecca and isaac  NEWLINE old and yet ever new and simple and beautiful always  NEWLINE love immortal and young in the endless succession of lovers  NEWLINE so through the plymouth woods passed onward the bridal procession \n",

NEWLINE sunny days may likewise be foretold  NEWLINE by the sharp twinkle of the stars the moon NEWLINE rising to face her brother’s rays by day  NEWLINE no tenuous fleeces blowing in the sky  NEWLINE no halcyons sea favorites on the shore NEWLINE stretching out their wings in tepid sunlight  NEWLINE but mists go lower and lie on the fields  NEWLINE the owl observing sundown from his perch  NEWLINE modulates his meaningless melancholy  NEWLINE aloft in crystal air the sparrow hawk NEWLINE chases his prey and as she flits aside NEWLINE the fierce hawk follows screaming on the wind  NEWLINE and as he swoops she flits aside again  NEWLINE with funereal contractions of the windpipe NEWLINE the crows produce their caws three at a time  NEWLINE and in their high nests pleased at i know not what  NEWLINE noise it among themselves no doubt rejoicing NEWLINE to see their little brood after the storm  NEWLINE but not i think by reason of divine NEWLINE insight or superior grasp of things  NEWLINE  NEWLINE  NEWLINE viii but if you carefully watch the rapid sun NEWLINE and the moon following a fair night’s snare NEWLINE never deceives you as to next day’s weather  NEWLINE when the new moon collects a rim of light  NEWLINE if that bow be obscured with a dark vapor  NEWLINE then a great tempest is in preparation  NEWLINE if it be blushing like a virgin’s cheek  NEWLINE there will be wind wind makes diana blush  NEWLINE if on the fourth night most significant  NEWLINE she goes pure and unclouded through the sky  NEWLINE all that day and the following days will be  NEWLINE for one full month exempt from rain and wind  NEWLINE the sun too rising and setting in the waves  NEWLINE will give you weather signs trustworthy ones NEWLINE whether at morning or when stars come out  NEWLINE a mackerel sky over the east at sunrise NEWLINE means look out for squalls a gale is coming  NEWLINE unfavorable to trees and plants and flocks  NEWLINE or when through denser strata the sun’s rays NEWLINE break out dimly or aurora rises NEWLINE pale from tithonus’ crocus colored chamber  NEWLINE alas the vine leaf will not shield the cluster NEWLINE in the hubbub of roof pattering bitter hail  NEWLINE it will be well to notice sunset too  NEWLINE for the sun’s visage then has various colors  NEWLINE bluish and dark means rain if it be fiery NEWLINE that means an east wind if it be dappled NEWLINE and mixed with red gold light then you will see NEWLINE wind and rain in commotion everywhere  NEWLINE nobody can advise me on that night  NEWLINE to cast off hawsers and put out to sea  NEWLINE but if the next day passes and the sunset NEWLINE then be clear you need not fear the weather  NEWLINE a bright norther will sway the forest trees  NEWLINE  NEWLINE  NEWLINE ix last what the late dusk brings and whence the fair NEWLINE clouds are blown and secrets of the southwind NEWLINE you may learn from the sun whose prophecies NEWLINE no man denies seeing black insurrections  NEWLINE treacheries and wars are told by him  NEWLINE  NEWLINE when caesar died the great sun pitied rome  NEWLINE so veiling his bright head the godless time NEWLINE trembled in fear of everlasting night  NEWLINE and then were portents given of earth and ocean  NEWLINE vile dogs upon the roads and hideous NEWLINE strange birds and aetna quaking and her fires NEWLINE bursting to overflow the cyclops’ fields NEWLINE with flames whirled in the air and melted stones  NEWLINE thunder of war was heard in germany NEWLINE from south to north shaking the granite alps  NEWLINE and a voice also through the silent groves NEWLINE piercing and apparitions wondrous pale NEWLINE were seen in dead of night then cattle spoke NEWLINE  o horror streams stood still the earth cracked open NEWLINE and tears sprang even from the temple bronze  NEWLINE the po monarch of rivers on his back NEWLINE spuming whole forests raced through the lowland plains NEWLINE and bore off pens and herds and then continually NEWLINE the viscera of beasts were thick with evil  NEWLINE blood trickled from the springs tall towns at night NEWLINE re echoed to the wolf pack’s shivering howl  NEWLINE and never from pure heaven have there fallen NEWLINE so many fires nor baleful comets burned  NEWLINE it seemed that once again the roman lines  NEWLINE alike in arms would fight at philippi  NEWLINE and heaven permitted those thessalian fields NEWLINE to be enriched again with blood of ours  NEWLINE some future day perhaps in that country  NEWLINE a farmer with his plow will turn the ground  NEWLINE and find the javelins eaten thin with rust  NEWLINE or knock the empty helmets with his mattock NEWLINE and wonder digging up those ancient bones  NEWLINE  NEWLINE paternal gods ancestors mother vesta  NEWLINE you that guard tiber and the palatine  NEWLINE now that long century is overthrown  NEWLINE let not this young man fail to give us peace  NEWLINE long enough beneath your rule o caesar  NEWLINE heaven has hated us and all those triumphs NEWLINE where justice was thrown down—so many wars  NEWLINE so many kinds of wickedness no honor NEWLINE rendered the plow but the fields gone to ruin  NEWLINE the country folk made homeless and their scythes NEWLINE beaten to straight swords on the blowing forge  NEWLINE war from the euphrates to germany  NEWLINE ruptured engagements violence of nations  NEWLINE and impious mars raging the whole world over— NEWLINE as when a four horsed chariot rears away NEWLINE plunging from the barrier and runs wild  NEWLINE heedless of the reins or the charioteer  NEWLINE terrorizers of themselves laughers in NEWLINE language and priests of any mystery— NEWLINE not by authority  NEWLINE  NEWLINE what of the revered NEWLINE historian the painstaking public man  NEWLINE his dusty briefcase worn to a splitting bulge  NEWLINE the scholar descending from the library NEWLINE smiles at the doves and at the glowing grass  NEWLINE letters gone frail and yellow in their strings NEWLINE spill fuzz and dust from the stuck folds  NEWLINE it might be inferred from what the ambassador NEWLINE wrote to his daughter in virginia NEWLINE that others were privy to the situation  NEWLINE these judges are gentle and well cultivated NEWLINE honorable stylists penetrating men  NEWLINE mirrors of duplicity and bewilderment  NEWLINE mirrors of magnificent deep rooted structural NEWLINE policy and implacable miscarriage  NEWLINE the documents are all photostated the files NEWLINE arranged let humane logic NEWLINE guide them in the wilderness of the state  NEWLINE the pallid husbandman grunts at his fields  NEWLINE sells his new lambs in the damp of march  NEWLINE thumbs the slick catalogue of the mail order NEWLINE house for ginghams for the girls of summer  NEWLINE chews with the county agent at the gate  NEWLINE he will be ruddy as the sun goes over  NEWLINE the clouds go over the tractor shudders on NEWLINE through the high fields the piling west will grow NEWLINE fractious with lightning the wild branches bend  NEWLINE curtains blow out like goodbye handkerchiefs NEWLINE hilarious in the gloomy wind autumn NEWLINE comes with marriages to the aging house  NEWLINE winter comes with comforts and old death  NEWLINE still the farmer’s dull hand holds the seed  NEWLINE the low star glimmers on the dewy sill \n",
